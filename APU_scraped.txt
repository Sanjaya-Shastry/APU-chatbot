From Textbooks to Transformation – Rethinking Education in Rural India
My time at Azim Premji University reset more than just my routine. It reignited the joy of learning, pausing to reflect, unlearn, and imagine better ways of being and something more than just an educator. I loved thinking deeply, challenging ideas, and engaging in a good debate. The real game-changer? Differentiated assessments. They let me engage meaningfully, in ways that worked for me: That’s exactly why I signed up.Bhargavi ManivannanPG Diploma in Inclusive Education, 2024-25

Electives6 credits
While the core courses cover foundational aspects of management, students will also get to explore some of their areas of interest beyond what the core courses offer. A few such courses will be offered as electives in the fourth term. The participants can choose three electives of two credits each from a basket of courses. An indicative list of electives is given below.
Technology for Development
Contemporary Development Debates
Operations Management for Social Sector Organisations
Strategic Management for Social Sector Organisations
Monitoring and Evaluation
Social Entrepreneurship
Corporate Social Responsibility
Field Practice10 credits
The programme ensures that learning is embedded in real-world contexts – both communities and organisations. While the core and elective courses will help build the perspectives, competencies and intellectual curiosity of the students, field engagement is crucial for developing sensitivity and empathy, while also honing skills in managing organisations. This experiential learning is facilitated through two components:
A two-week long field immersion
An eight-week long internship in a social sector organisation
Classroom Practices
The classroom practices in our programme are designed to ensure an inclusive and immersive learning experience, blending theory with hands-on practice. The programme uses a diverse mix of lectures, group discussions, peer learning, audio-visual materials, and case studies to make complex concepts accessible to students from a wide range of academic and socio-economic backgrounds and work experience.
Group work is a key aspect of the programme, emphasising the importance of collective learning and collaboration. Field experience is integrated into the programme structure, offering students opportunities for immersive, real-world experiences, thus helping students apply classroom learning to address fundamental organisational issues in social sector organisations.
Many courses feature guest lectures from sector experts and practitioners who bring contemporary, real-world insights into the classroom. Our faculty members are highly accessible, offering additional support during office hours.
Career Opportunities
The programme will prepare students to be future leaders of social sector organisations, responsible to all stakeholders in the society. Some opportunities for transformative career shifts and possible career trajectories include:
Leading the implementation of large programmes in social sector organisations
Facilitating organisational growth through people management and fundraising
Playing a leadership role in the rapid growth environment of social enterprises, large cooperatives and farmer producer companies
Managing programme grants at donor foundations, philanthropies andCSRteams
The University has a strong track record in placements and 100+ organisations recruit our students every year, including leading national and international non-profits,CSRfoundations, development consultancies, and impact-driven enterprises.
A dedicatedPlacement Cellprovides comprehensive support, training, and career guidance, helping students navigate their professional journeys with confidence. Additionally, theSocial Enterprise Cellsupports those interested in launching their own impact-driven ventures.

Azim Premji Foundation
Our story
Education for social change
Azim Premji Foundation
Contributing to a just, equitable, humane and sustainable society.
The Foundation’s vision is to contribute towards a more just, equitable, humane and sustainable society. Its work is focussed on India.
Azim Premjiset up the Foundation in 2001. Over the past years, he has irrevocably donated most of his wealth to fund the philanthropic work of the Foundation. As a part of the endowment created by these donations, along with other assets, 66% of the economic ownership of Wipro Ltd is with the Foundation.
Foundation​‘on-the-ground’
The Foundation does extensive and deep​‘on-the-ground’workacross the country – both directly through itsown operationsand throughpartners. The work spans education to other important areas of equity and human wellbeing.
Foundation’s Field Institutions
The Foundation works on improving the equity and quality of theschool educationsystem in India, with a focus on the more disadvantaged areas of the country. The work ranges fromteacher capacity development and leadership developmentto matters ofpolicyand curriculum, including a significant contribution to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and National Curriculum Framework 2023.
The Foundation’s Field Institutions are spread across 7 states and 1 Union Territory which have over 3,50,000 schools. In addition, the Foundation also works deeply with 7 states in the northeast of the country and selectively in many other (currently 5) states. There are 59 institutions in the field working with these school systems. The Foundation also runs 9schoolsfor​‘demonstration and training’.
The Foundation’s own team of over 1700 people in the Field is spread across 263 locations.
The Field Institutions are in some of the most disadvantaged districts of India, each staffed with 10 – 60 members. The Foundation also runs 263​“Teacher Learning Centres”, in these districts.
This deep institutional presence is now being leveraged by the Foundation to work onHealth,Livelihoods, and a few other key initiatives (mentioned below), starting with a few regions and then expanding.
Partners:
The Foundation supports over 1000 other not-for-profit organisations (NPOs) across the country with multi-year grants and selectively with corpusgrants. These NPOsdo deep​‘on-the-ground’ work across a range of issues — supporting people who are severely disadvantaged and marginalised with immediate care, access to essential services, and the possibility of a dignified future. Such support to partners is also growing rapidly.
Some of these vulnerable groups are urban poor, persons with disability, women facing violence, adolescent girls at risk, children at risk, homeless, elderly poor, manual scavengers, migrant workers, farmers with marginal landholding, particularly vulnerable tribal groups and water-deficient communities.
This work also involves collaboration with state governments and groups of NPOsto address issues systemically — beyond immediate care and support. Some such collaborations are: in Odisha, an effort to improve nutrition and hygiene; in Andhra Pradesh, improving the livelihood of small and marginal farmers; a multi-state programme to strengthen local governance andPanchayati Rajinstitutions; in Tamil Nadu, setting up centres in district hospitals to rescue, treat and rehabilitate mentally ill homeless individuals; supporting access to the judicial system for the vulnerable.
Universities
The Foundation is building a network of its own universities to contribute to capacity development and research for the social sector.
The firstAzim Premji Universitywas set up in Bengaluru in 2010 and today operates from a 110-acre campus. The second one, i.e.,Azim Premji University, Bhopal, started in 2023 in a 50-acre campus. The work on the third campus in Ranchi has started on a 150-acre site, and this will be operational by 2026 and subsequently a fourth campus in the northeast part of India, is planned.
Azim Premji University has been offering degree programmes since 2011. Its mandate is to run teaching programmes and conduct research to contribute to the social sector in India, and to be an exemplar higher education institution – with inclusion and quality.
The masters, diploma, and short duration programmes are focused on domains of human development; for example, Education, Livelihoods, Development, Governance and Policy, Public Health, and Sustainability. The undergraduate programmes offer a broad-based liberal education – integrating the fields of human development that are the focus of the University.
The research programmes are designed for direct contribution to matters of policy and practice, in these very fields of human development, for example, through dedicated research centres on Employment, Climate Change and Local Democracy (Panchayats).
Capacity development of civil society and public system professionals is a key priority for the University. We offer a range of programmes in critical areas like early childhood education, inclusive education, disability, assessment, educational leadership, social sector leadership, and local democracy, reaching over 1 lakh practitioners annually.
The University produces a large collection of teaching-learning material for free public use. These include magazines in school subjects, development case studies, online textbooks, translations of higher education material, etc.
The Foundation’s on-the-ground operations and the University integrate real grassroots and systemic knowledge to contribute to policy, research and continuing education.
Twelve cohorts of over 4300 students from the programmes have graduated from the University and almost 100 percent of the students from the master’s programmes have received job offers on campus. Nearly 90 percent of these students have chosen to work in the social sector — many in grassroots field locations across the country.
The Universities are entirely philanthropic; currently 89 percent of the expenditure is borne by the Foundation. Currently, about 60 percent of students are on scholarships offered by the University. The student body is very diverse, from across 29 states and varied socio-economic backgrounds.
Health
While the Foundation contributes to a large range of domains and issues of human wellbeing as mentioned, over 20 years of direct work inSchool Educationhas built deep expertise in that domain and is now buildingHealthas a similar domain of expertise and contribution.
The work in Health has started in Bengaluru and in the states of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. This work will strengthen the public health system — where required complementing and supplementing it — including running primary health clinics, secondary and tertiary hospitals.
TheMaster of Public Health programmeat the Bhopal campus is an initial step in contributing towards development of capacity in the Heath sector. At the Ranchi campus, amedical college with its associated 550-bed tertiary hospitalwill be set up. Plans include setting up two more such medical colleges and hospitals.
In addition to our own work in Health, the Foundation is collaborating with several partners – including hospitals and NGOs— to make healthcare accessible to vulnerable communities and to improve community health across a much larger geography.
New initiatives
The Foundation is also in the initial phases of afew other significant initiatives, associated or adjacent to our work in Education and Health, which could contribute deeply to human wellbeing. Some of the key initiatives are:
Strengthening thenutritional content of mid-day mealsfor children in government schools and Anganwadis by providing an egg (or its substitute) every day to every child. This project, first implemented in Karnataka, is benefitting over 55 lakh children, will be rolled out across multiple states over the next 2 years.
Settingup and running creches in rural areasfor infants and children under the age of 3 in some of the remotest geographies. The first 675 creches are operational in Odisha, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh.
Scholarshipsfor support of higher education ofgirls across India—starting with 30,000 scholarships in 2024 and going up to 2,50,000 scholarships in the academic year 2025 – 26.
Anational Youth Programmeto support development of young people to do constructive social work, manifesting the values of our Constitution. Currently the programme has about 1.25 lakh young people in about 3000 youth groups.
In a few geographies, intense work has been started toimprove significantly the livelihoods of those in poverty. The challenge is to help foster local economic development in these​‘livelihood regions’, such that there is a substantial increase in overall value in the local economy, thus enabling significant increase in household level incomes — equitably, with ecological sensitivity, and responding to the aspirations of local youth populations. Our own operations have been initiated on this in a few blocks in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, which will expand, and the initiative will expand to other regions in collaboration with our partners.

Our story
Education for social change
Education for social change
We are a space for social change.
We believe that education can and should contribute to human development and well-being. Over the years, we have nurtured a community of individuals motivated by the values enshrined in the Indian constitution: a commitment to social justice, equity, humane values and sustainability.
We believe that higher education can create critical and reflective practitioners with an understanding of the social impact of education, the law and development.
Ourprogrammesare designed to prepare reflective and critical practitioners who can bring their educational experience at the University to practice on the ground — with competence, integrity, and most of all, social commitment.
A caring community
We believe that social change begins with care.
We care for the well-being of each individual in our community. We hope that learning can be a dynamic and creative process that will help all individuals discover their potential.
Our diverse community of students are from all over India with a wealth of experiences. They come from a vast diversity in socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. We understand that generations of social inequality in India makes the experience of the classroom unique for each student.
We support our student community through the various challenges they face in their academic journeys, inside and outside the classroom.
In the classroom
We strive to create an inclusive environment for learning. We provide assistance and different forms of support in the classroom to ensure that disadvantages of social background do not hinder a creative and fulfilling academic experience.
Our community of faculty and mentors are committed to a caring classroom experience. We provide academic support for foundational capacities in language, reasoning and quantitative analysis through the course of different academic programmes. We offer remedial support whenever necessary for students to get through their coursework.
We help each of our students understand their hopes and nurture their dreams.
Beyond the classroom
University is a time for the exploration of oneself and the world. We support our students through the challenges they face not only in the classroom but in the peer group and in their personal lives.
We ensure a supportive and collegial environment and access to help for those in need and understand that special circumstances may arise any time.
We providecounselling serviceson and off campus, along with peer-support groups run by students on campus. Our mentorship programme takes care of each individual through the course of their study.
Financial assistance
We believe that nobody should drop out because of financial problems. We provide extensive financial aid to help students fund their study.
Careers
We ensure that our graduates make successful choices in the jobs they go on to do. OurPlacement Cellensures that our graduates are equipped with the skills needed to make effective decisions in a competitive environment of jobs. We assist our students in finding employment opportunities well suited to their needs.

Azim Premji Foundation
Our story
Education for social change
Our story
We have unusual origins.
In early 2000, Azim Premji Foundation set out to work in the field of elementary education in government schools across India. The Foundation hoped to contribute to improve the quality of education of India at a deep and institutional level in close partnership with the government.
Over the years, the Foundation set up district-level institutes that worked to improve the capacity of teachers, school leaders, teacher educators and administrators in public education.
A decade of grassroots work generated critical insights into the challenges and opportunities on the ground. The biggest need of the hour was for well-qualified professionals in the social sector.
Azim Premji University was set up in response to this need in 2010. We began with two programmes ineducationanddevelopment, along with courses for working professionals that enhanced the capacity of those who already work in the field.
Azim Premji University was founded in 2010, with the vision to contribute to the realisation of a just, equitable, humane and sustainable society.

Our Recruiters
I have had the good fortune of working with young graduates of theMAin Development programme of the Azim Premji University for over a decade. The University instils in young professionals a certain sense of purpose, and provides them with the initial grounding needed to work in community focussed rural development. There are two qualities that stand out among the youngsters from Azim Premji University: a sense of intellectual humility and willingness to explore new lessons; and the ability to work in difficult physical and emotional settings.
Opportunities for our students
Passionate, capable and with a social bent of mind, our graduating students are looking for work opportunities. They are eager to work in various domains of Education and Development in the country, such as Livelihood, Public Health, Public Education, Policy Analysis, Developmental Economics, Sustainability, Community Level Engagement, Teaching, Programme Management and Evaluation, Research, Content Development, Writing etc.
We invite you to our Campus for recruiting our graduating Undergraduate and Postgraduate students.

Our alumni at work
Making small and meaningful changes for a better India.
Our alumni are a valued part of our community. Their work after graduation helps us nurture our vision of a just, equitable, humane and sustainable society.
From the river islands of Majuli on the Brahmaputra river, to the urban neighbourhoods of Bengaluru, our alumni work in non governmental organisations, government and quasi government bodies, policy making institutes, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and small social sector organisations. Some of our alumni have gone on to start their own organisations, working with issues as diverse as running schools, providing employment to people with disabilities, to improving agricultural practices.
Over 4382 alumni work across 500 locations across India, and many at the grassroots.

Research Centres
At the University, our research is focused on questions of India’s futures and is allied to our vision of a just, equitable, humane, and sustainable society. The emphasis of the Research Centre is on contributing to practice on the ground in India’s vast social sector, and high-quality academic scholarship in the areas of development, education, public policy, governance, sustainability, and equity.
The Research Centre facilitates research by all members of the Foundation. From the frontline work of the Foundation on the ground, we collate research to help our stakeholders understand the real issues in education. We bring together researchers from the University and outside to foster collaborative work. Our work is deeply rooted in the field, and we produce research in the form of scholarly articles to writing for the public, including books for children.
Our specialised Centres work on the most socially pressing and relevant concerns of India today. They are multidisciplinary undertakings and bring together theoretical and practical excellence. Our three Centres at present address questions that relate to climate change and sustainability, sustainable employment, and concerns of local democracy.

Working Paper Series
About
The Working Paper Series provides a platform for members of the university to document and publish their wide-ranging research work, experiences in implementation of programs and development of processes. Launched in 2016, the series has published 25 standalone contributions so far, and they offer significant insights for academicians and practitioners. Papers in this series undergo two rounds of rigorous review (comprising an internal review and an external review) before they are published.
Objectives
The objective of the working paper series is to:
Cultivate a practice of structured documentation and effective and quicker communication of a diverse spectrum of disciplinary and cross-disciplinary work.
Disseminate this body of work to a wider audience through free online access as well as in print.
Why write for the Working Paper Series?
Working Paper Series
Provides a platform to publish documentation of processes and implementation efforts, apart from research work.
Provides detailed reviews and helps bring out interim publication(s), while allowing authors to retain the right to publish elsewhere.

University Working Paper SeriesExploring Beneficiary Awareness and Access to Grievance Redressal Systems in Government-Sponsored Health Insurance Schemes in Gujarat, Indiain
Azim Premji UniversityPublished2024AuthorsMoreAbstractThe Government of India launched Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) in 2018 to mitigate catastrophic out-of-pocket health expenditure. This government-sponsored health insurance scheme is implemented through six digital portals, including a grievance redressal system, with the involvement of multiple stakeholders. The grievance redressal mechanisms inPMJAYare aimed at ensuring access to information, contribute to the responsiveness of the scheme and safeguard it against any fraudulent practices.As a pioneering effort, this research explores the role and experiences of grievance redressal systems by exploring the following research questions: 1) What are the processes of collecting and responding to grievances inPMJAY? 2) How is the awareness about the Grievance Redressal System among the beneficiaries?, and 3) What is the experience of beneficiaries of interaction with the Grievance Redressal System ofPMJAY?A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted from January 2022 to August 2023 in Gujarat, using a mixed-method approach to data collection from various primary and secondary sources. The findings from the study show that multiple formal and informal channels are active with varying accessibility among the beneficiaries. A significant proportion of beneficiaries were unaware of their entitlements and grievance redressal mechanisms. Awareness was low regarding internet-based formal channels and communication through letters or emails.The findings underscore the necessity for enhanced outreach efforts, using detailed information dissemination via print and outdoor media. Building trust in the grievance redressal system is essential to increase its use and demand among the beneficiaries. Insights from this study will be useful to strengthen the grievance redressal system of thePMJAYscheme or similar government schemes.More →LinksRead OnlineRepositoryBookmark

Abstract
The Government of India launched Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) in 2018 to mitigate catastrophic out-of-pocket health expenditure. This government-sponsored health insurance scheme is implemented through six digital portals, including a grievance redressal system, with the involvement of multiple stakeholders. The grievance redressal mechanisms inPMJAYare aimed at ensuring access to information, contribute to the responsiveness of the scheme and safeguard it against any fraudulent practices.
As a pioneering effort, this research explores the role and experiences of grievance redressal systems by exploring the following research questions: 1) What are the processes of collecting and responding to grievances inPMJAY? 2) How is the awareness about the Grievance Redressal System among the beneficiaries?, and 3) What is the experience of beneficiaries of interaction with the Grievance Redressal System ofPMJAY?
A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted from January 2022 to August 2023 in Gujarat, using a mixed-method approach to data collection from various primary and secondary sources. The findings from the study show that multiple formal and informal channels are active with varying accessibility among the beneficiaries. A significant proportion of beneficiaries were unaware of their entitlements and grievance redressal mechanisms. Awareness was low regarding internet-based formal channels and communication through letters or emails.
The findings underscore the necessity for enhanced outreach efforts, using detailed information dissemination via print and outdoor media. Building trust in the grievance redressal system is essential to increase its use and demand among the beneficiaries. Insights from this study will be useful to strengthen the grievance redressal system of thePMJAYscheme or similar government schemes.

University Working Paper SeriesGovernance of Yellow Foot Clam: a case study of Ashtamudi Lake in Keralain
Azim Premji UniversityPublished2020AuthorsMoreAbstractYellow foot Clam (Paphia malabarica) fishery of the Ashtamudi lake, one of the deepest lakes in Kerala supports the livelihoods of thousands of clam-collectors in the region. These clams are highly demanded in the international market and it enables the clam-collectors to generate their income through export began in late 80s. An increased export market demand exerted a lot of pressure on the resource which ultimately led to the depletion of clam resources. As a response to this unexpected decline in resource size and lost income, the clam collector community in Ashtamudi came forward to address the issue by forming a collective of clam-collectors at the village level. As a management strategy, they voluntarily abstained from fishing during the breeding season and demanded management of resource through a participatory mode of governance. After years of experience in the management of resource through voluntary measures, Ashtamudi clam resource entered a new régime of resource management. It got certified as​“sustainable” resource by the world’s largest marine wild-catch certification program, the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) which promotes the governance of marine fisheries resources through market incentives. This study is an attempt to understand these varied and unique governance régime experiences of clam resource from participatory to market-based systems and the implications of these governance regimes in the property rights, livelihoods and social development of clam-collectors of Ashtamudi.More →LinksRead OnlineRepositoryBookmark

It argues that conventional demographic factors cannot explain the abnormal population growth rates reported in parts of Manipur and that the abnormalities in the headcount might instead be explained by the manipulation of census data driven by political and economic considerations.

Azim Premji UniversityPublished2020AuthorsMoreAbstractRecent work on informal urbanism argues that​‘informality’ is a strong force in determining and shaping how cities in the global south grow, and hence needs to be a part of emergent urban theory. This paper uses this argument as a starting point, drawing upon the work of scholars who suggest that urban informality may have an organizing logic, a system of norms that emerge from the economic conditions and the social needs of people. Specifically, this paper examines informality in the urban space as an outcome of spatial and economic changes in a market precinct in Bangalore. It finds that activities in the street are temporal in nature. In this paper, the ordinary city encapsulates how people use urban spaces on an everyday basis and the extraordinary city reflects how urban spaces are transformed during a periodic, religious and cultural festival. The paper makes two key contributions, one, to show through an in-depth spatial ethnographic study how the​‘ordinary – extraordinary’ might help us understand informal urbanism and two, to propose that it may be useful to have intermediate levels of planning that incorporate the conditions of the​‘ordinary’ city as well as the​‘extraordinary’ city, thereby contributing to both theory and practice.More →LinksRead OnlineRepositoryBookmark

University Working Paper SeriesPolitical and programmatic decentralization in India’s health sector : insights from Karnatakain
Azim Premji UniversityPublished2019AuthorsMoreAbstractWhile India has made progress in achieving important health sector goals, there is still a long way to go. The Government of India has adopted decentralization or devolution with the objective of promoting greater equity and supporting people-centred, responsive health systems. We report on a study that problematizes the idea of strengthening health sector governance through decentralization and that explores the intersection of the political goal of enhanced local-level autonomy and the programmatic goal of more responsive health service delivery. The study examines the extent to which both political and programmatic decentralization are functional at the village level; looks at the design and objectives of decentralization at the village level; and considers whether sustained and supportive capacity building can create the necessary conditions for more genuine de facto decentralization and empowerment of village-level functionaries. Our methodology included semi-structured interviews with village-level functionaries in two districts of Karnataka, based on which we designed an Action Research to strengthen coordination and synergy between the functionaries responsible for political and programmatic decentralization. We found that both political and programmatic decentralization at the village level are at risk due to a lack of convergence between the political and programmatic arms of the government. This is substantially due to problems inherent in the design of the decentralization mechanism at the district level and below. Sustained capacity building can contribute to the more effective application of decentralization mechanisms, but systemic issues regarding the decentralization mechanisms need to be addressed alongside. We were also able to identify some spaces where coordination between village-level functionaries is possible, and the steps that need to be taken to build on this potential.More →LinksRead OnlineRepositoryBookmark

University Working Paper SeriesThe Limitations of India’s Census Legislationin
Azim Premji UniversityPublished2019AuthorsMoreAbstractMost discussions on the quality of government data overlook the legal framework within which data are collected. This paper examines India’s Census Act, 1948, which provides the legal-administrative framework for conducting human population census. The Act stipulates punishment for interfering with the process of enumeration, but the punitive provisions are rarely used and have not been invoked to deal with cases of mass manipulation of the census. Major instances of manipulation were, in fact, reported in 1951 and 2001 after the government introduced additional punitive measures in 1948 and 1994, respectively. This paper compares the Census Act, 1948 with other Indian laws related to the collection of statistics as well as census laws of other common law countries and identifies the structural flaws of the Indian law vis-à-vis manipulation. It uses simple games to explain why the punitive provisions of the Census Act, 1948 are redundant in the event of mass manipulation and suggests that the problem can be addressed without recourse to law. The insights drawn from the games are examined in light of the experience of Nagaland, a state of India where census statistics were manipulated on a large scale in 2001.More →LinksRead OnlineRepositoryBookmark

University Working Paper SeriesThe persistent nucleus: atoms, power and energy policy discourse in the anthropocenein
Azim Premji UniversityPublished2018AuthorsMoreAbstractDespite economic debacles, recurring​“accidents”, reactor core meltdowns in Chernobyl and Fukushima and the cautious academic reflection it has engendered, civilian nuclear power continues to enjoy legitimacy in energy policy discourse. This may not be the case in all countries. But it is so in a number of influential states, such as, prominently, all the permanent members of theUNSecurity Council. Why does nuclear power persist in these and other key countries, such as India or Iran and Japan? How is it that economic costs, technology risks and weapons proliferation concerns point in one direction while energy policy and technology choice moves in the other? We suggest that for an important set of select countries this divergence can be ascribed to a​“discourse of power” that is pegged to domestic concerns and, more importantly, to international relations. This discursive process constructs energy and material abundance as the cornerstone of social stability, political power and ultimately national sovereignty and geopolitical influence. The atom’s energy remains prominent in such imaginaries of abundance, more so in contexts of fossil energy insecurity and climate change. The questioning then of nuclear power by environmental and social concerns has to also question this discourse of power. The latter’s sanguinity vis-a-vis abundant energy needs to be problematised. This is not the case today in international relations. Practitioners focus on the consequences of environmental deterioration. The problem of climate refugees, for example. This paper argues that realist frames of power and self-interest in international relations be acknowledged explicitly as drivers of the discourse of power and in turn the socio-ecological consequences that ensue from this pursuit of cheap and abundant energy. To challenge nuclear power ultimately is to also challenge this medieval yet dominant norm of power play that pervades large swathes of international relations.More →LinksRead OnlineRepositoryBookmark

University Working Paper SeriesA call for development of a growth standard to measure malnutrition of school-age childrenin
Azim Premji UniversityPublished2018AuthorsMoreAbstractThere is no globally established standard for measuring malnutrition among children aged 5 – 18 years. Growth references are used as a standard but there are many limitations to using such references to assess nutritional status of Indian children. As per the World Health Organization, standards and references both serve as a basis for comparison, but each enables a different interpretation. A standard defines how children should grow; and deviations from the pattern it prescribes are evidence of abnormal growth. A reference, on the other hand, does not provide a basis for such value judgments, although in practice, references often are mistakenly used as standards. This paper has conducted a methodological review of prevalence of malnutrition from openly accessible literature pertaining to assessment of nutritional status of school-going children in India from the year 2000 to 2016. The methodological review reveals that a combination of different national and international references have been used in assessing nutritional status of Indian children. International references includesNCHS1977,CDC2000,WHO2007,IOTF2012 extended Body Mass Index (BMI) cut- offs, Gomez classification, Waterlow’s classification and national references such as — Agarwal standards,ICMRreference values,IAPreference andBMIcut-off for overweight&obesity of Indian children. A new national growth reference has been recently developed by Marwaha and others (2011) forBMI, but no assessment of nutritional status using this reference was found. Each of these methods was then applied to a database containing height, weight, age and sex of 5340 school-going children. Though there are three nutritional indicators for school-age children, majority of the study conducted used onlyBMIchart to assess nutritional status. Therefore BMI-for-age is considered for the analysis to i) understand the methodological application of the above growth references ii) compare the differences in nutritional status and iii) recommend an appropriate growth reference (from those available) to assess the nutritional status of Indian school-age children. The literature review also reveals that malnutrition among school-age children is prevalent in India. There is no national level data available to support this judgement across regions, gender and caste. Given a likely high prevalence of malnutrition, this paper calls for the development of a growth standard to measure malnutrition among school-age children in India. Though this paper is focused on malnutrition, it simultaneously provides similar importance to over growth. A growth Standard therefore fills up such gaps in measuring double burden of malnutrition i.e. under-nutrition and over-nutrition.More →LinksRead OnlineRepositoryBookmark

University Working Paper SeriesLakes of Bengaluru : the once living, but now endangered peri-urban commonsin
Azim Premji UniversityPublished2018AuthorsMoreAbstractCities of the Global South are expanding both spatially and demographically. While urbanization may contribute to economic growth and employment generation, the impacts of urbanization on sustainability of cities is manifold. One area that is witnessing rapid land use change as a result of urbanization is the peri-urban interface of cities in India. This is especially true in the case of natural spaces that are also common pool resources. In this working paper, we examine the transformation of lakes in the peri-urban interface of Bengaluru city in the south Indian state of Karnataka. Based onGPSobservations and interviews, we found that lakes in our study area varied in status and use: ranging from those in a good condition that served multiple uses to those converted to other forms of land use, resulting in loss of all services. We also accessed archival information to underscore the role that one of the lakes in the study area played in serving as a source of water during a time of scarcity. Using the example of lakes in Bengaluru, this paper presents the threats faced by commons in the peri-urban interface of rapidly expanding cities in the Global South. These threats are not restricted to changes to land use alone, but also concern their transformation into recreational sites at the cost of users who depend on them for livelihood and subsistence. We argue for management of the lakes in the peri-urban interface not only as ecosystems that supports ecological and economic uses, but as commons that are a reflection of the diversity and heterogeneity that cities such as Bengaluru represent.More →LinksRead OnlineRepositoryBookmark

University Working Paper SeriesNSSOsurveys along India’s periphery : data quality and its implicationsin
Azim Premji UniversityPublished2017AuthorsMoreAbstractSample surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) are the most widely used sources of household level information about consumption, employment, and other socio-economic indicators in India. The representativeness of samples, the wide range of topics surveyed, and the availability of a long-time series are some of the reasons for the appeal ofNSSOdata for research and policy. This paper assesses the quality of theNSSOdata for Nagaland and Jammu and Kashmir, which lie in India’s politically restive ethno-geographical periphery. It argues that theNSSOdata for these states during 1973 – 2014 lack representativeness and inter-temporal comparability due to faulty sampling frames, frame and sample non-coverage, and biased samples. It quantifies the impact of data quality on statistics of interest to policy-makers. The paper shows that the estimates of monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) are sensitive to non-coverage and argues that the incidence of poverty is underestimated becauseNSSOsurveys failed to capture the complete distribution of consumption expenditure due to non-coverage. In Nagaland, the degree of non-coverage was so high that in most years between 1993 – 94 and 2011-12 the state’s poverty headcount ratio was the lowest in the country despite the possible overestimation of its poverty line. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the use of non-representative survey data. Put together, the unreliability of government statistics in Jammu and Kashmir and Nagaland highlights systemic problems that have wider implications for our understanding of the relationship between state, statistics, and policy-making.More →LinksRead OnlineRepositoryBookmark

Azim Premji UniversityPublished2017AuthorsMoreAbstractThis paper explores the construction of hybrid spaces through the observation of middle school children engaged in short science projects in an informal science learning programme. Hybrid spaces are not just physical structures, but refer to contexts, relationships and knowledges developed by children as their social worlds and identities merge with the normative expectations of school science. Hybrid spaces have been characterised in three different ways: as a convergent space between academic and traditionally marginalized knowledges and discourses; as a navigational space, or a way of crossing and succeeding in different discourse communities; and as a space of cultural, social and epistemological change where competing knowledges and discourses challenge and reshape both academic and everyday knowledges. (Moje et al., 2004; Barton et al., 2008). This paper characterises such hybrid paces by analysing activities of children working on short projects in the broad area of:​‘Trees, plants and insects’, during a summer camp held at the Azim Premji University. Children seemed to primarily use the​‘third space’ to navigate between different funds of knowledge and succeed in science. They developed science artefacts such as scrapbooks and a children’s magazine, and negotiated new roles for participating and expressing their developing science identities. They also brought in local knowledge and activities from their home contexts such as gardening, cooking and socialisation with members of their own and wider community. Informal settings help in the negotiation, construction and development of these hybrid spaces, and is particularly meaningful for children who otherwise see science as being alien and outside their everyday lives. Children brought different funds of knowledge into their participation and discussions from both their formal and informal experiences linked to science. Children decided their own trajectory of learning experiences in consultation with the facilitator. This paper also describes various possibilities in informal settings and learning experiences within and outside formal school settings, which help children explore and engage more deeply with their developing interests in science.More →LinksRead OnlineRepositoryBookmark

University Working Paper SeriesExploitative Informal Labour Process in India: a conceptualisationin
Azim Premji UniversityPublished2017AuthorsMoreAbstractThis working paper will focus on conceptualising why informal labour continues to persist in the Indian economy. More specifically, it will try to theorise why, despite generating growth, informal labour has been locked in unequal and exploitative terms of contracts. Crucially, it will try to understand why informal labour processes do not evolve mechanisms for providing security and support to labour in the form of benefits and rights. In this paper, I will focus specifically on highly exploitative and unequal informal labour processes. I categorise under this category those labour processes that do not provide a mechanism to reproduce labour power. These processes are predicated on maximising the appropriation of surplus from labour, without providing any provision to support the workers in ill health, facing work related accidents and injuries, or due to retrenchment. While informal labour is defined as labour without legal rights or contracts, I specifically focus on those processes where there do not exist any norms or mechanisms of providing security to labour within the production process. Hence, I refer to these processes as highly exploitative and unequal labour processes. This paper will be structured in the following manner. Firstly, it will introduce the concept of labour process and argue that highly exploitative informal labour processes in India broadly fall into two distinct labour processes namely: informal coercive accumulation process and petty commodity production. It will then derive concepts from the Paris Regulation School to modify the labour process framework. It will then describe concrete case studies conducted by other researchers, to demonstrate that this framework can be utilised to make sense of field work based research on the informal sector. Lastly, I will assess the questions posed in this paper based on the derived framework and will argue that informality is connected to the nature of capitalist development in India.More →LinksRead OnlineRepositoryBookmark

University Working Paper SeriesRole of voluntary teacher forums (VTFs) in continuous teacher professional development in India: experiences from Rajasthan, Karnataka and Puducherryin
Azim Premji UniversityPublished2017AuthorsMoreAbstractThe quality of education depends largely upon the teacher. Hence building teacher capacity through continuous professional development of teachers is critical to the quality of education. Systems and programs for continuous professional development for school teachers in the formal educational system in India are inadequate and often ill-conceived. Apart from other lacunae, they often do not recognize the professional identity and agency of the teacher. Voluntary Teacher Forums (VTFs) that are facilitated by Azim Premji Foundation in different locations of India, as part of an integrated and multimodal approach to continuous professional development, try to address this central issue. This study shows that VTFs are evolving as very useful platforms for collaboration and peer learning amongst teachers in various locations. It shows that given an environment that allows for easy access to meaningful opportunities, teachers will commit their time, talents and resources to their own professional development. The study further recognizes however, that the real issue is to understand how such forums can be made to happen in different locations in a context as complex as the Indian public education system. While this study highlights certain crucial dimensions of the VTFs – including what happens within these forums and the efforts that go behind it – these continue to be subjects for our future research works.More →LinksRead OnlineRepositoryBookmark

University Working Paper SeriesCurbing crony capitalism in Indiain
Azim Premji UniversityPublished2017AuthorsMoreAbstractEconomic reforms sought to replace the Indian statedominant economy with a liberal, competitive market economy. However, a plethora of recent scams indicate that collusive rentsharing arrangements between business and policy makers are prevalent. A nexus has developed, linking politicians and business, as well as the bureaucracy. These trends signal a breakdown of competitive markets and the accumulation of wealth via corruption. This paper explains crony capitalism within a framework of interaction between four stakeholder groups whose motives and behaviour have altered in the recent context.

University Working Paper SeriesNotes on Nagaland’s areain
Azim Premji UniversityPublished2017AuthorsMoreAbstractEmpirical research in economics and, to a lesser extent, in other social sciences is largely dependent upon government statistics. It is generally assumed that governments are committed to collecting and disseminating correct statistics. As a result, the mutually constitutive relationship between politics, economy, and statistics, and the possibility of systematic manipulation of statistics-driven by the structural features of this relationship, has received insufficient attention within economics. This paper examines the implications of the absence of shared preferences over the quality of statistics within a government. It explores the multiplicity of conflicting maps of the State of Nagaland issued by different tiers and wings of the government to underscore the lack of attention paid to a statistic as crucial as area. The paper situates the cartographic-statistical confusion in its political and economic contexts, and suggests that political-geographic arguments are being used to advance political-economic interests along contested borders. It argues that the confusion is not amenable to a technical resolution as it is linked to the dispute over Nagaland’s place within the Union of India and the border disputes between Nagaland and its neighbouring states.More →LinksRead OnlineRepositoryBookmark

University Working Paper SeriesAn intervention into the debates on​‘work-in-education’ and skill development in Indiain
Azim Premji UniversityPublished2016AuthorsMoreAbstractThe paper analyses the debates surrounding​‘work’ as part, or as an outcome, of school education in India and argues that these have not reckoned adequately the socioeconomic reality of the corresponding times. The outcome of education depends on ideas and resources shaping its provisioning, and the use by the people. Colonial rulers provided a liberal schooling which did not aim at​‘schooling for all’ or imparting skills as part of schooling. Such an education was attractive to those children who were not working in agriculture or artisanal occupations for their livelihood or who belonged to a​‘rentier’ class. The lower opportunity cost of time for these children and the probability of getting a job in the colonial administration enabled this small section of society to opt for such a liberal schooling. It is in this context that Gandhi wanted to use work (or agricultural and artisanal skills) as a pedagogical tool for education. However, the majority of children who were bound to do such work then did not view formal schooling, which aimed at imparting these​‘skills’, attractive.More →LinksRead OnlineRepositoryBookmark

University Working Paper SeriesWhat we ate then and what we eat now : a grandmother’s talein
Azim Premji UniversityPublished2016AuthorsMoreAbstractMalnutrition levels in India remain a major public health challenge. According to the fourth round of the District Level Household Survey (DLHS‑4, 2012 – 13), almost 30 percent of all children under the age of 5 are underweight in most states. This is a serious cause for concern for several reasons: low weight-for-age has been associated with a range of disadvantages, including a higher risk of dying due to several disease conditions among young children; changes in the autonomic nervous system; higher risk of hypertension and insulinresistance in adulthood; adverse impacts on brain development, cognitive ability and school achievement; and behavioural problems such as anxiety and hostility later in life.More →LinksRead OnlineRepositoryBookmark

Community Engagement Initiative (CEI)
Student Engagement
Community Engagement Initiative (CEI)
An initiative towards enhancing human conditions around campus
The Community Engagement Initiative is a continuous engagement with the local and surrounding communities towards improving human conditions and sustainability around our campus with a deep commitment to nurture public institutions and services.
Snippets from the various field engagements of our students
Why Community Engagement Initiative?
To use the knowledge and expertise of the University, Field institutes of Azim Premji Foundation, and the Philanthropy arm of the Foundation to contribute to improving human conditions and sustainability in the villages around the campus.
To provide opportunities for students, the University and the rest of the foundation members to contribute and learn from the community engagements.
To build a harmonious relationship between the University and the villages around the campus.
Our external community
TheUniversityis located in the Burugunte village of Billapura Panchayat, Anekal taluk, Bengaluru. Currently, we engage with 9 Gram Panchayats around campus: Billapura, Handenahalli, Sarjapura, Mugaluru, Yamare, Dommasandra, Muthanallur, Neriga and Bidaraguppe.
These Gram Panchayats consist of 40 villages and 23 wards, with a population of 1.9 lakh, constituting a substantial portion of migrant labourers, farming communities, and petty businesses that are dependent on surrounding industries and residential apartments.
There are 2 Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and 8 Health sub-centres in the neighbourhood of the campus.
Further, 46 government schools, 7 panchayat libraries, and 2 veterinary hospitals are also present in this geography.
Furthermore, there are around 50 lakes in these Gram Panchayats ranging from 10 acres to 200 acres in size.
Current Engagements
Community Learning Centre (CLC)
We provide academic support to more than 20 children of our support staff and a few community children on our campus during the weekends. Along with activity-based learning sessions, the children also have exposure to the university resources. The sessions are primarily facilitated by our student volunteers with support from our University members.
Creating a stable market for local farmers
We have launched a weekly ​“Vaarada Santhe” at the University. In collaboration with the Sarjapura Farmer Producer Organisation, we are working in transforming our consumer producer collective into a vibrant open market. Every week, a farmer producer group from Mugaluru Panchayat brings their fresh produce to our stalls, offering a wide range of vegetables, fruits, organic leafy greens, millets, jaggery, wood-pressed oils. This initiative also invites local Self Help Groups (SHG) to sell delicious ready-to-eat products and offers a live food counter for the university community. Through this initiative, over ₹2 lakh has been raised to directly support farmers, reinforcing our commitment to sustainable livelihoods and community engagement.
Empowering panchayat libraries
CEIhas been engaging with the 28 libraries of Anekal taluk in activities such as monthly reflection and planning meetings, workshops and training, events like Kannada Rajyothsava, Children’s Day, and other national/​state important days.CEIalso organised computer literacy programmes, community awareness programmes, setting-up of children’s corner, on-site support, books arrangement, enhancing aesthetics in the neighbouring panchayat libraries as part of the overall engagement to activate these spaces for local children, youth and other community members. The objective is to revitalise and re-energise the rural public library spaces.
Empowering sustainability through culinary collaboration: A new frontier with local SHGs
The Sustainability Committee, in collaboration with the Community Engagement Initiative, has disseminated comprehensive guidelines for organising sustainable events on campus. A standout recommendation from these guidelines was to foster collaboration with local SHGs, particularly in the realm of catering. This approach not only advances the University’s sustainability objectives — such as reducing environmental impact and encouraging local sourcing — but also contributes meaningfully to the economic empowerment of women in nearby communities.
Contributing to University events
Taking an active role in University events, we partnered withSHGmembers to cater food for various university functions. More than 100SHGmembers enthusiastically participated in a range of events organised by the University (Idea Challenge Event, World Education Forum, Unmukt, Social Enterprise Mela, and so on) showcasing our commitment to community involvement. To date, SHGshave successfully catered to 187 events on campus, collectively generating an income of aroundINR24 lakhs.
Capacity Development and Involvement ofSHGmembers in Community activities
Our engagement extends beyond individual initiatives asSHGmembers actively participate in community development activities. These include cleanliness drives, celebrations of important days, and drives to enhance school enrolment within the community. Over 250SHGwomen from the neighbourhood Panchayat participated in workshops focused on improving financial literacy, entrepreneurial skills, leadership skills. Thirteen women entrepreneurs working in sectors such as food production, paper bag making, floriculture, agriculture, and tailoring have received targeted support to expand their ventures, including linkages facilitated through the Smile Foundation. In response to local demand, tailoring courses were organised in Bidaraguppe and Mugaluru, where 60SHGwomen successfully completed a five-month training programme. Furthermore, 12 women entrepreneurs — both individuals and groups — have actively participated in initiatives such as the National Social Enterprise Idea Challenge, weekly markets, and university fairs, showcasing their business ideas and gaining valuable exposure and networking opportunities.
Engagement with youth
The youth empowerment efforts in Dommasandra and surrounding areas have made a positive impact through various programmes. These include theMountains of Life, which engaged 30 youths, enhancing their learning and participation, andSpoken English Classesat the local library, improving language skills for 14 participants. With the linkage ofSAN-ITCentre,we worked with over 15 youth to develop computer, communication and leadership abilities. TheNational Social Enterprise Idea Challengeexposure visits inspired 22 youths with leadership skills. Collaborations with local youth groups, such as theVijaya Sarathi Youth Groupand others in Dommasandra, Mugaluru, and Handenahalli, promoted cultural, educational, and skill-building activities. TheSVPCollege Youth Groupfostered creativity through arts, music, and theatre, encouraging future development.
Empowering women and youth through language, skills, and fitness
Sustainability Committee in collaboration with the Community Engagement initiative, has recently disseminated comprehensive guidelines for organising sustainable events on campus. A standout recommendation from these guidelines was to foster collaboration with local SHGs, particularly in the realm of catering. This strategic decision not only aligns with our sustainability goals but also plays a crucial role in supporting the livelihoods of local women.
Launch of community disability intervention
University’s disability team along with the Community Engagement Initiative and in collaboration with the Sarjapura Primary Health Centre (PHC) has crafted interventions to support members with disabilities in the community. We aim to bring about an inclusive system in the community and institutions we work with. Following screening, interventions will commence to provide rehabilitation services and referrals.
Launch of mental health services at DommasandraPHC
Our University’s Centre for Positive Mental Health and Wellbeing (Conversations) team is now offering mental wellbeing sessions at SarjapuraPHCto the community service providers in collaboration with the local health team since January 2024. We have initiated the patient screening, prioritising patients with chronic stress and vulnerable community groups suffering from diseases like tuberculosis and cancer. The team launched 8 sessions on activity-based experiential approach to work with Accredited Social Health Activitists (ASHAs) using expressive art therapy and narrative practices. We will soon move to group sessions for community members to expand the support. We will also empower the frontline workers with training to identify mental health concerns in the community.
Promoting responsible waste management practices
We are collaborating with a partner organisation (Hasiru Dala) at Billapura Gram Panchayat to create a zero waste Panchayat in the Anekal Taluk. Waste collection centre has been established at Billapura and it is functional as of January 2025. Gram Panchayat functionaries along with representatives are trained on their respective roles and responsibilities of the intervention, on a regular basis. We also take them on various site visits for exposure and understanding. We aim to create a sustainable model by involving the Gram Panchayat Level Federation (GPLF) to run the initiative in order to create livelihood opportunities.
Social security and entitlement drives
We work closely with the marginalised communities in and around the University. With the aim to build a safety net for informal workers on campus and vulnerable communities in the neighbourhood, we are trying to create an enabling environment by providing awareness about various government programmes and schemes.
CEIhas organised several outreach drives in the villages around the University. Further, we have facilitated drives to enrol 1600 community members for schemes such as e‑Shram, Ayushman Bharat Health Account (ABHA) and Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Yojana.CEIhas also enrolled 70 support staff of the University inESI, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY), and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMBSY).
Strengthening local democracy
We have completed the pilot phase of our initiative aimed at strengthening local democracy in Billapura Panchayat. We worked to fortify sub-committees within the Panchayat, fostering a more robust and efficient organisational structure. Identifying and empowering 60 second-line leaders has been a pivotal step in enhancing the Panchayat’s leadership network. Through targeted capacity training, we expect these leaders to be better equipped to address the challenges faced by the community.
We facilitated training of Panchayat representatives, ensuring they are well-versed in their roles and responsibilities. This initiative is instrumental in fostering a more informed and proactive local governance. We also facilitated in organising for a Gram Sabha in October 2024. This event witnessed the active participation of over 100 key stakeholders who voiced their concerns and challenges. Since July 2024, Community Resource Persons (CRPs) have mapped more than 100 common ecological resources in 4 gram panchayats to establish asset registers.
Bridge programme around our neighbourhood
We have initiated a Grade X support programme at Sarjapura High School with the help of the District Institute team and the concerned school authorities. Our university members have volunteered to take up classes in subjects such as Social Science and English on a weekly basis. The purpose of this program is to provide additional academic support to the class 10 students for their upcoming board exams.
Along with this, we conducted craft&art, clay and constitutional education sessions at Attibele government school. The plan is to have more such sessions in other government schools in our neighbourhood with the help of ourDIteam and volunteers.
Research in community and service learning courses
Our research strategy is a methodological approach in which knowledge is generated for practical intervention purposes as well as academic discussions and community​‘ownership’ is encouraged. Current projects are:
“Entrepreneurial Ecosystem in Anekal Taluk: An exploratory research project”, to pilot a few micro-enterprises in our neighborhood.
“Testing the Feasibility of a Community Centred Model of Waste Management”, to create a model for community based and citizen centric waste management.
We offer​“service learning” courses to ourUGstudents, a combination of classroom learning and working in the neighbourhood under faculty supervision. Current courses areLibrary as a Site for Holistic LearningandSustainable Waste Management in the Community Context.

Social Enterprise Cell
Social Enterprise Idea Challenge
9th National Social Enterprise Idea Challenge
Social Enterprises established by our Alumni
Social Enterprise Mela
Social Enterprise Cell
A platform to encourage students to find innovative solutions to some of the most complex social problems that we face in the world today.
Our Social Enterprise Cell was set up in 2015 to enable our students to share, debate and discuss their ideas. It also helps them network with individuals, incubators and like-minded groups towards creating their own social ventures.
The cell is anchored by a University member, with the support of others who form a core group. Interested students from each batch volunteer, plan and organise all our yearly activities.
Our Objectives
Our objectives align with our University’s explicit social purpose.
To promote awareness about social entrepreneurship among our students as a tool for social action
To nurture and guide entrepreneurial initiatives of our students and alumni
To act as a resource centre for the social enterprise ecosystem in India through various events, programmes and publications.
We believe that our primary purpose is to make a social impact by solving critical and complex societal problems on the ground.
Activities
We conduct various structured workshops and small capacity building programmes for our students which involve people from the University and external resource people. Some of the workshops are about design thinking, finance and budgeting of organisations, proposal writing, communication and outreach as well as organisation building.
We organise regular on-campus interactions with young budding social entrepreneurs, some of whom are our own alumni. The invitees share their journey and struggles with interested students.
In the coming years, we intend to nurture the matured ideas of recent graduates as well as alumni to provide providing mentoring and non-financial support.
In 2016, we launched a national level Social Enterprise Idea Challenge event for college and University students across India.

Game. Set. Mismatch. No love lost for Archana VenkataramanIn the 1990’s, Archana Venkataraman was a star on the rise. Since she was four, her tennis-obsessed family shuttled her from one tournament to another, one coaching clinic to the next. At seventeen, she was crowned the National Champion. Her place did not go unchallenged. At the finals of the National Games in 2002, Archana came up against a younger, hungrier, grittier rival — 16-year-old Sania Mirza. Playing the newcomer on her home turf in Hyderabad and booed by a hostile crowd of spectators, Archana went down in a firestorm of deuces. It takes a lot to succeed in a sport as expensive and competitive as tennis, more so for an Indian woman. In over a century, only four  have made it to a Grand Slam event. Viewed in that sobering light, Archana Venkataraman’s story is one worth telling. Listen to it on Almost Perfect.

Swaying Minds and Shaping the Modern Indian Economy
This project explores the contributions of modern Indian economists, whose ideas and analyses have not only shaped India’s economic trajectory but also generated a deeper understanding of development and growth in the country. It aims to provide a comprehensive platform for understanding the intellectual legacy of Indian economists within the broader context of economic theory and the unique challenges of modern India. In doing so, we hope it helps fill in two gaps. First, it addresses the lack of information on Indian economics and economists online on the one hand. And second, it is a contribution to the quest for a more pluralistic economics.The economists featured in this site are no longer with us but their ideas have been central for understanding economic processes and in particular, taking head on the specific questions that were faced by the newly independent nation. They come from all regions of the country and are from various political and methodological persuasions. But they all had something in common:  to paraphrase the economist Robert Heilbroner: they all swayed people’s minds.We have been fortunate to have had several well-known academics and economists who were willing to write extensively and outline the lives and pioneering contributions of these thinkers. They are mentioned in the articles, and this project would not have been possible without their efforts.This is meant to be a living resource and while here we begin with around two dozen economists, we hope to update and expand the resources here over time. We hope not only to feature many more economists, but also to expand to different aspects of Indian economic history (specific debates, institutions and committees and so on).
If you are a student, researcher, or simply curious about the intersection of economics and history, this project invites you to explore the rich intellectual heritage of modern Indian economists and their enduring relevance in addressing the challenges of today and tomorrow. It is also a labour of love and we expect that despite our best efforts, there may be some infelicities or inaccuracies. Please do write to us if you find any and we will be happy to correct them. Should you feel there is a glaring omission, or better still, wish to contribute a piece, please do contact us as well.

ArticleScholarly Insights into Sustainability, Climate Change,&Blue Food: A Perspective Aligned with Adoption of Sustainable Development Goalsin
Springer NaturePublished2025AuthorsAnkur JamwalMohit SharmaMoreAbstractThe increasing global demand for food, coupled with the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation, has shifted attention towards blue food systems. While these systems offer a potential solution to food security challenges, their sustainability is threatened by various factors, including overfishing, habitat destruction, and climate change. Recognising these challenges, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO,UN) advocates for ensuring the sustainable contribution of aquatic food systems to global food security and nutrition, aligning with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs). It was hypothesised that adoption of UN-SDGs would increase the interest of researchers in sustainability of fisheries and aquaculture. Therefore, a bibliometric analysis of the relevant literature published between 2000 and 2023 was conducted to test this hypothesis. The analysis revealed a significant rise in publications addressing climate change and sustainability after the adoption of the UN-SDGs. The countries exhibiting high vulnerability to climate change contributed disproportionately fewer publications to the database. The United States emerged as the leading contributor in terms of publication volume, while Canada’s University of British Columbia was identified as the institution with the highest number of contributing authors. The findings underscore pronounced geographical disparities in research output, with a predominance of countries from the Global North. The underlying factors contributing to these disparities are discussed. Furthermore, the study discusses the policy implications of these findings and emphasises the imperative to prioritise equitable research initiatives.

ReportRural Multidimensional Deprivation in Jharkhand: A Data-Driven Analysis 2024in
Azim Premji UniversityPublished2025AuthorsSchool of DevelopmentMoreAbstractThis report constructs a Rural Multidimensional Deprivation Index (RDI) for measuring deprivation in Jharkhand. An important feature of the index is that it is constructed using indicators on provisioning of basic infrastructural amenities at the village level. This is different from the usual poverty indices that are composed of financial indicators such as income or consumption; or indicators measuring development outcomes such as educational or nutritional levels. Observing the provisioning of basic infrastructural amenities, this report makes focused policy suggestions that can be easily implemented by functionaries working on the ground. The data for the index is sourced from the Mission Antyodaya Survey, which was carried out in 2019 at the village level across the country. The survey collects data related to provisioning and outcome of basic amenities in villages, along with demographic and socioeconomic variables. Because this is a periodic survey, it enables us to track the developmental progress of each village, district, state and the country over time. In total, there are about 182 variables that were captured in the 2019 round. The survey covers 31,175 out of 32,620 villages in Jharkhand, which is 95.6 percent of the total number of villages in the state; and 6,48,358 out of 6,67,933 villages in India, or 97.1 percent of the villages in the country.EditorsPrasanna S,Sandhya Krishnan, Sanket Gharat,Puja Guha,Amalendu Jyotishi,Neeraj HatekarMore →LinksRead OnlineRepositoryBookmark

CSE Working Paper SeriesBuilding Capabilities of Informal Workers by Recognition of Prior Learning: The Current Practice and Alternativesin
Azim Premji UniversityPublished2025AuthorsCentre for Sustainable EmploymentMoreAbstractRecognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is a key pillar of India’s Skill India mission under the National Policy for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (NPSDE) 2015, aimed at formalizing the skills of its vast informal workforce, which accounts for over 91% of total employment. By bridging the gap between experiential learning and formal certification,RPLhas the potential to enhance employability, economic mobility, and workforce productivity. However, India’sRPLimplementation faces significant challenges, including regulatory misalignment, limited industry adoption, and low stakeholder awareness, along with logistical barriers such as evidence verification and assessment costs. Primarily certification-driven, it lacks integration into the vocational training system, limiting its effectiveness as a pathway for skill advancement and higher income. Moreover,RPLis often used as a shortcut to boost certification numbers rather than as a tool for meaningful skill development. This paper examines the evolution, implementation, and impact ofRPLin India using national labor force survey data while benchmarking it against global best practices from countries such as South Africa and theUK. The study identifies key policy gaps and proposes strategic recommendations to strengthenRPL, ensuring it transitions from a certification-centric model to a robust mechanism for workforce inclusion, quality vocational education, and sustainable skill development.Authors:Santosh Mehrotra  , Anita Sharma  and Vinay Swarup MehrotraMore →LinksRead OnlineBookmark

Second, the often-benevolent administration in Punjab during the colonial rule. Third, the development of a discourse of caste-progressiveness of Jats. The Punjab experience in this regard is significant to understand similar processes in other states and to make appropriate strategies for social movements and policy advocacy regarding agrarian/​social reforms.RésuméCet article présente un compte rendu historique de l’émergence et du développement du pouvoir territorial des Jats au Pendjab en analysant trois éléments.

ArticleWhat is the value of value for agrarian studies?in
Journal of Agrarian ChangePublished2025AuthorsSchool of Arts and SciencesMoreAbstractReflecting a longstanding intellectual heritage in Marxist political economy, contributions to agrarian studies have variously referred to the production, distribution and extraction of value. Despite this central role within the heritage of agrarian studies, the concept of value is often used inconsistently between authors and sometimes deployed without clear elucidation of the underlying theoretical tenets. As such, value often tends to be used more as a metaphor suggestive of conditions of exploitation rather than a detailed conceptual framework. In response, we must ask if there is still a robust case for value analysis forming a foundational pillar of agrarian studies? To address this challenging question, we invited three authors to give their perspective on the value of value for agrarian studies. First and foremost, we asked them to consider what value analysis does that is otherwise missed in critical agrarian studies and how we can mobilise its potential to sharpen analyses. Two further pivotal questions arise, spurred on by recent trends in the literature. First, to what extent do the categories of value enrich or hinder our evolving understanding of the dynamics of social reproduction within agrarian households and communities, including the gendered relations through which agriculture and livelihoods are performed? Similarly, are the largely anthropogenic concepts of value fit for the purpose of explaining environmental change and the more-than-human dynamics through which agricultural landscapes are produced and change over time?Authors:A Haroon Akram-Lodhi,Srishti Yadav, Alessandra Mezzadri, Marcus TaylorMore →LinksRead OnlinePublisher ListingBookmark

ArticleMethodological Holism in Marx’s Capital Volume 1: The Conceptualisation and Measurement of Individual Unitsin
Sage JournalPublished2025AuthorsMoreAbstractThis article aims to understand the methodological position that Marx takes inCapitalVolume 1 and the implications of that on the individual units in his analysis. With the understanding that Marx adopts a fundamentally holist methodological standpoint, the article outlines how the individuals within classes and the system of capitalist production are measured and contextualised. This question is answered by examining Marx’sCapitalVolume 1 as the primary text. Where relevant, the author engages with Marx’s intellectual background and tradition. The individual units discussed in this study are the commodity, the worker and the capitalist.This article examines how the concept of the representative individual emerges through averaging and how this process unfolds in Marx’sCapital, shaped by his methodological approach. The article illustrates the method of averaging in Marx, through his intellectual engagement with Quetelet as it also focusses on Hegel’s influence on Marx’s method and elaborates on the parallels and divergences between them. With the given engagement withCapitaland Marx’s intellectual interactions, we arrive at a specific understanding of holism that can be attributed to Marx inCapitalVolume 1.Author:Sushmita Rama SubrahmanyamMore →LinksRead OnlinePublisher ListingBookmark

With the understanding that Marx adopts a fundamentally holist methodological standpoint, the article outlines how the individuals within classes and the system of capitalist production are measured and contextualised. This question is answered by examining Marx’sCapitalVolume 1 as the primary text. Where relevant, the author engages with Marx’s intellectual background and tradition. The individual units discussed in this study are the commodity, the worker and the capitalist.
This article examines how the concept of the representative individual emerges through averaging and how this process unfolds in Marx’sCapital, shaped by his methodological approach. The article illustrates the method of averaging in Marx, through his intellectual engagement with Quetelet as it also focusses on Hegel’s influence on Marx’s method and elaborates on the parallels and divergences between them. With the given engagement withCapitaland Marx’s intellectual interactions, we arrive at a specific understanding of holism that can be attributed to Marx inCapitalVolume 1.

ArticleThe​“Global Learning Crisis”: The Classroom View from Kanchipuram, Indiain
Comparative Education ReviewArticlePublished2025AuthorsMiriam ThangarajMoreAbstract“Global learning crisis” narratives, in focusing on the​“proximate determinants” of the crisis, represent a welcome​“classroom turn” in international education and development.

ArticleRecent allopolyploidization and transcriptomic asymmetry in the mangrove shrub Acanthus tetraploideusin
Springer NatureArticlePublished2025AuthorsMoreAbstractBackgroundMangrove species are vital to the ecosystems of tropical and subtropical coastlines worldwide. Despite the underexplored role of polyploidization in these species, deciphering its impact on gene expression is essential for understanding the connection between polyploidization and species diversification.

Expanding on these insights, this study utilises genome-wide evidence to confirm the divergence patterns among extantAcanthusmangrove diploids and to investigate the origin and transcriptome asymmetry of the tetraploidA. tetraploideus.ResultsPhylogenetic analysis and molecular dating revealed a closer evolutionary relationship betweenA. ebracteatusandA. volubilisthan betweenA. ebracteatusandA. ilicifolius, diverged approximately 6.92 Mya and 9.59 Mya, respectively.

Abstract
Background
Mangrove species are vital to the ecosystems of tropical and subtropical coastlines worldwide. Despite the underexplored role of polyploidization in these species, deciphering its impact on gene expression is essential for understanding the connection between polyploidization and species diversification. Our initial investigation, integrating multiple nuclear loci with morphological and cytological data, indicates that the tetraploidAcanthus tetraploideuslikely originated from allopolyploidization events involving the diploid speciesA. ilicifolius and A. ebracteatus. Expanding on these insights, this study utilises genome-wide evidence to confirm the divergence patterns among extantAcanthusmangrove diploids and to investigate the origin and transcriptome asymmetry of the tetraploidA. tetraploideus.
Results
Phylogenetic analysis and molecular dating revealed a closer evolutionary relationship betweenA. ebracteatusandA. volubilisthan betweenA. ebracteatusandA. ilicifolius, diverged approximately 6.92 Mya and 9.59 Mya, respectively. Analysis of individual whole transcriptomes revealed that homeologous sequences inA. tetraploideuswere preferentially clustered withA. ilicifolius and A. ebracteatus, rather thanA. volubilis, in a roughly 1:1 ratio. The high similarity in nucleotide sequences and homologous polymorphisms between the tetraploidA. tetraploideusand its two parental diploids,A. ebracteatusandA. ilicifolius, supports the hypothesis of a recent allopolyploid origin forA. tetraploideus.

ArticleGendered inclusions and exclusions: Intersectional media discourses during the pandemic in India and theUSAin

Migrants, whose everyday lives, with or without the pandemic, are disrupted and defined by borders and their liminalities, were the most certain victims of these closures. All media platforms around the world reported on migrant workers, either villainising them as carriers of the virus or sympathising with them as victims of continued racist assaults and ruthless state policies.

ArticleEcosystem services in the Alps: visitors’ perceptions of two alpine protected areasin
Taylor & FrancisPublished2025AuthorsMoreAbstractUnderstanding users’ perception of natural areas and their ecosystem services is crucial for managers and policy makers as it directly informs decisions that balance conservation efforts with public acceptance. The alpine areas are particularly vulnerable to climate change, making it critical to understand how visitors perceive these areas to develop management strategies that minimize conflicts, helping to ensure long-term support for environmental protection. This study explores the perceptions of 21 ecosystem services – including cultural, regulating and provisioning services – among visitors of two protected alpine areas in Italy. We distributed 3,399 questionnaires to evaluate visitors’ perceptions of the importance of key ecosystem services, their awareness of the ecosystem services concept and any shifts in perception due toCOVID-19, as the study took place during an ease of restrictions caused by the pandemic. Additionally, we explored the relationship between perceptions and demographic factors. Results showed that visitor strongly perceived the importance of the aesthetic value of the landscape and biodiversity conservation. Perception of the overall importance ofESwas strongly correlated with demographic factors, such as gender, age and a connection to outdoor and naturalistic activities. Visitors who were already aware of theESconcepts exhibited higher perceptions compared to those who did not acknowledge them, suggesting the need for targeted communication strategies to extend the awareness of theESconcept.

ArticleMGNREGAas a Technological Laboratory: Analysing Wage Payment Delays as a Result of Two Digital Interventionsin
Springer NaturePublished2025AuthorsMoreAbstractThe Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is India’s rural employment guarantee programme that provides 100 days of work to each household and mandates payment of wages within 15 days of completion of work.MGNREGAhas been subject to many technological interventions purported to improve efficiency and transparency. Many of these interventions were introduced without any consultation or scientific piloting resulting in violation of workers’ rights. We focus on two digital interventions. Firstly, in the financial year 2021 – 22, wage payments of workers were segregated based on their caste. Notwithstanding delays in wage payments, we find there is a statistically significant difference in the time taken to process payments across caste. This provides an empirical corroboration of how this move created caste tensions at worksites. Just in our sample, the compensation as per law that is payable to workers due to delays by the union government alone is ₹399 million. This is neither acknowledged nor paid. Secondly, we demonstrate that there is no statistically significant difference either in timely payment of wages or in payment rejections between the Aadhaar-Based Payment System (ABPS) and the standard account-based methods. Our analysis is based on 31.36 million transactions across 10 states from financial year 2021 – 22 crawled from the programme’s Management Information System. This is the first large-scale data-based evidence debunking officially stated claims of timely payments due toABPS. We also examine official government circulars, documents retrieved using Right to Information responses combined with our immersive fieldwork to underscore our findings. In summary, we argue that any digital technology introduced inMGNREGAor any other social policy must be done through a consultative process, independent audits, giving centrality to workers’ rights.Authors:Suguna Bheemarasetti, Anuradha De,Rajendran Narayanan, Parul Saboo&Laavanya TamangMore →LinksRead OnlineBookmark

ArticleLattice Engineering Triggered Phase Formation of Bimetallic Thiospinels with Excellent HzOR andOERActivity for Energy-Efficient Hydrogen Productionin
ChemCatChemPublished2025AuthorsMoreAbstractIntroducing foreign elements into a crystal lattice could trigger phase transformation, serving as an excellent means to fabricate highly electrocatalytic phases. NiCo2S4 is a notably electrocatalytic thiospinel phase, normally synthesized via two-step route and rarely explored for electrocatalytic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). This work reports one-step hydrothermal syntheses of NiCo2S4 and CuCo2S4 and their performance for HzOR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Time-dependent syntheses suggest formation of (M, Co)9S8; M=Ni/Cu phase, followed by conversion to the respective thiospinel phase. Computational study validates that the incorporation of Ni into Co9S8 disrupts its stability and induces the formation of a stable bi-metallic thiospinel phase. Even without the assistance of metal foam substrate, NiCo2S4 displayed remarkable activity for HzOR requiring potentials of 153 and 350 mV to afford current densities of 10 and 500 mA/​cm2, respectively. Furthermore, NiCo2S4 showed good activity forOER, providing 10 mA/​cm2 at 290 mV. For hydrazine-assistedH2production, the two-electrode setup, NiCo2S4||Pt/C attained a current density of 10 mA/​cm2 at 140 mV, which is 1.39 V less than that required for conventional water electrolyzer (1.53 V). Long-term durability of NiCo2S4 for both HzOR andOERat high current densities highlights the suitability of the catalyst for practical applications.Author/​s:Diya Raveendran, Viplove Mishra, Athma E.

ArticleAccumulation by Dispossession: Evidence of Shrinking Space for Small-scale Fishers of Karnataka Coastin

Abstract
Small-scale fisheries play an important economic, social and cultural role in coastal Karnataka even today despite being subjected to several natural and anthropogenic stressors for a long time. They are neglected or even outright discouraged in the state’s fisheries policymaking, and their contributions to the state’s fish supply and their role in livelihood creation do not receive the due recognition. This paper is premised on the recognition of emerging stressors that pose a threat to the viability of small-scale fisheries. The impacts of these stressors have implications not only for the environment but also for nutrition, particularly among vulnerable populations, and the overall socio-economic stability of coastal communities that rely on fishing as a livelihood. The goals of this paper are to provide a thorough review of literature around these stressors, and to describe how these are being played out in coastal Karnataka. Among these stressors, we delve in depth on the new Blue Economy policy of India since it is likely to have severe antagonistic effects in combination with other anthropogenic stressors. Our opinion is, Karnataka has already started witnessing many of these ramifications of interventions/​stressors and the coastal landscape of the state is set to be transformed over the next couple of decades or so. Small-scale fisheries of the state are likely to be some of the most impacted communities from these interventions.

ArticleHousehold energy choices under fuel stacking scenarios: evidence for bundling welfare schemes for facilitating clean fuel usein
IOP Publishing LtdPublished2024AuthorsMoreAbstractEnergy poverty related to a reliance on traditional biomass for cooking has a strong association with environmental degradation, gender inequity and human health. Reduction of energy poverty is a growing concern in public policy agenda globally. In India, the last decade has seen concerted efforts to provide clean cooking fuel to the population. Despite this, wide regional disparities in energy poverty exist in India, indicating differential regional impacts of policies. A shift to universal access to clean modern cooking fuel requires the redesign of policies, with insights from a decentralized understanding of actual drivers of household cooking energy choices across diverse regions. The paper attempts to explain household cooking fuel choices under multiple fuel use (fuel stacking) scenarios in two states of India, differentiated by their socio-economic status and development trajectories. The paper employs multinomial logistic (MNL) regression on household level data from the Indian Human Development Survey 2015 to identify factors determining fuel choices. Urbanization,per capitaincome, the educational attainment of the household head and women in the household, having a separate kitchen for cooking and not living in one’s own house were observed to be positively influencing a switch to clean cooking energy in both the states. The results of the study indicate that shifting out of energy poverty and achieving the goal of universal clean cooking energy would require combining ongoing welfare policies with policies on provisioning clean cooking energy in India.Authors:M ManjulaMore →LinksRead OnlineBookmark

ArticleThe Ontological Choreography of Conservation Practice at a Marine Turtle Rookery in Indiain
Conservation and SocietyPublished2024AuthorsMoreAbstractThe Rushikulya beach in eastern India is considered to be an important rookery (nesting site) for a species of migratory marine turtle, the olive ridleysLepidochelys olivacea, because it is one of a handful of sites around the world where an arribada or mass-nesting event occurs. During an arribada, thousands of ridleys nest simultaneously over a small section of the beach, and several weeks later, millions of hatchlings emerge from these nests and crawl into the sea. Given the uniqueness of this phenomenon, conservation programmes have emphasised the monitoring and protection of ridleys during an arribada. In Rushikulya, this involves an assemblage of multiple actors, including biologists, their local assistants, and staff of the Odisha Forest Department. In this article, I use the concept of ontological choreography, drawn from multispecies scholarship, to focus attention on how members of this assemblage bring together different ontological orders, mainly nature and the individual self, to protect the ridleys. Further, I use this concept to direct attention to the hybrid nature of conservation practice — that it can simultaneously be affective, embodied, performative, sensory and technical. Overall, this article demonstrates how multispecies approaches can enrich social studies of conservation.Authors:Madhuri RameshMore →LinksRead OnlineBookmark

University Working Paper SeriesExploring Beneficiary Awareness and Access to Grievance Redressal Systems in Government-Sponsored Health Insurance Schemes in Gujarat, Indiain
Azim Premji UniversityPublished2024AuthorsMoreAbstractThe Government of India launched Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) in 2018 to mitigate catastrophic out-of-pocket health expenditure. This government-sponsored health insurance scheme is implemented through six digital portals, including a grievance redressal system, with the involvement of multiple stakeholders. The grievance redressal mechanisms inPMJAYare aimed at ensuring access to information, contribute to the responsiveness of the scheme and safeguard it against any fraudulent practices.As a pioneering effort, this research explores the role and experiences of grievance redressal systems by exploring the following research questions: 1) What are the processes of collecting and responding to grievances inPMJAY? 2) How is the awareness about the Grievance Redressal System among the beneficiaries?, and 3) What is the experience of beneficiaries of interaction with the Grievance Redressal System ofPMJAY?A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted from January 2022 to August 2023 in Gujarat, using a mixed-method approach to data collection from various primary and secondary sources. The findings from the study show that multiple formal and informal channels are active with varying accessibility among the beneficiaries. A significant proportion of beneficiaries were unaware of their entitlements and grievance redressal mechanisms. Awareness was low regarding internet-based formal channels and communication through letters or emails.The findings underscore the necessity for enhanced outreach efforts, using detailed information dissemination via print and outdoor media.

The grievance redressal mechanisms inPMJAYare aimed at ensuring access to information, contribute to the responsiveness of the scheme and safeguard it against any fraudulent practices.
As a pioneering effort, this research explores the role and experiences of grievance redressal systems by exploring the following research questions: 1) What are the processes of collecting and responding to grievances inPMJAY? 2) How is the awareness about the Grievance Redressal System among the beneficiaries?, and 3) What is the experience of beneficiaries of interaction with the Grievance Redressal System ofPMJAY?
A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted from January 2022 to August 2023 in Gujarat, using a mixed-method approach to data collection from various primary and secondary sources. The findings from the study show that multiple formal and informal channels are active with varying accessibility among the beneficiaries. A significant proportion of beneficiaries were unaware of their entitlements and grievance redressal mechanisms. Awareness was low regarding internet-based formal channels and communication through letters or emails.
The findings underscore the necessity for enhanced outreach efforts, using detailed information dissemination via print and outdoor media. Building trust in the grievance redressal system is essential to increase its use and demand among the beneficiaries. Insights from this study will be useful to strengthen the grievance redressal system of thePMJAYscheme or similar government schemes.

These emails or other correspondence include the Foundation logo, photos, links, names of senior officials or other information taken directly from Foundation’s official web site and containing a request for money or sensitive personal information.
Examples of such activity include:
Falsely requesting donations on behalf of the Foundation.
Falsely claiming that the Foundation has awarded a grant to the recipient, but that the grant can only be awarded once a fee is paid or certain sensitive personal information is provided.
Falsely soliciting individuals for funding to invest in Foundation projects.
Please be advised that the Foundation or Foundation employees, grantees, or partner organizations do not:
Approach individuals in person offering grant opportunities.

If you are the recipient of any such correspondence or are contacted by such scamsters or become aware of such scams issued from unauthorised email ids and domain names, please email alert@​azimpremjifoundation.​org. This alerts the Foundation of the potential scam and enables it to take appropriate action as deemed fit. We also advise you to refrain from responding to any e‑mail received from any unauthorized mail ids or from any person claiming to be an authorized representative of Foundation without verifying the veracity of the same.
Foundation assumes no liability for damages caused through unlawful or fraudulent usage of the Foundation’s name.

Growing Public Health Concerns in India
Over the last decade, India has experienced tremendous economic growth and improved health outcomes. The reductions in the Infant Mortality Rate, Maternal Mortality Rate, improvement in Life Expectancy, and becoming Polio-free are some of the significant achievements in the public health for the country.
Despite these successful outcomes, India still faces several public health challenges, including persistent malnutrition, health risks due to environmental degradation and climate change, and non-communicable diseases, including mental health and emerging infectious diseases.
TheCOVID-19pandemic was testimony to sharp inequalities in healthcare based on class, gender, ethnicity and region. To effectively tackle India’s growing public health challenges that address social inequalities in health, there is an urgent need for public health practitioners who are committed to the social purpose of public health in the country.
Who should join us?
At Azim Premji University, join us if you are looking for a programme that aims to provide opportunities for strengthening the public health ecosystem by enabling professionals to develop a grounded understanding of public health in India embedded in a commitment to equity, rights, and social justice values. The combination of theoretical principles and continuous engagement in the field gives opportunities to students to understand the current landscape and emerging challenges in public health.
Why study with us?
The Master of Public Health Programme is designed for medical or non-medical professionals interested in addressing India’s public health concerns. The programme brings together professionals from various disciplines to understand the causes of public health challenges and identify innovative solutions to improve the country’s health outcomes. If your heart is committed to improving the quality of life for communities, this programme offers excellent opportunities towards fulfilling careers.
The programme is an accelerator for early career professionals. The curriculum equips them with current and advanced knowledge and skills to contribute to research, advocacy, policy and programme. The comprehensive programme puts forth multiple perspectives helping professionals develop a sound understanding of the public health ecosystem.
Programme Structure
Good health and well-being is a fundamental right and should be accessible to all communities. Therefore, our curriculum deeply values equity, rights, and justice. What sets us apart is our programme design which is contextual, relevant and helps you understand existing and emerging public health realities and needs.

Growing Public Health Concerns in India
Over the last decade, India has experienced tremendous economic growth and improved health outcomes. The reductions in the Infant Mortality Rate, Maternal Mortality Rate, improvement in Life Expectancy, and becoming Polio-free are some of the significant achievements in the public health for the country.
Despite these successful outcomes, India still faces several public health challenges, including persistent malnutrition, health risks due to environmental degradation and climate change, and non-communicable diseases, including mental health and emerging infectious diseases.
TheCOVID-19pandemic was testimony to sharp inequalities in healthcare based on class, gender, ethnicity and region. To effectively tackle India’s growing public health challenges that address social inequalities in health, there is an urgent need for public health practitioners who are committed to the social purpose of public health in the country.
Who should join us?
At Azim Premji University, join us if you are looking for a programme that aims to provide opportunities for strengthening the public health ecosystem by enabling professionals to develop a grounded understanding of public health in India embedded in a commitment to equity, rights, and social justice values. The combination of theoretical principles and continuous engagement in the field gives opportunities to students to understand the current landscape and emerging challenges in public health.
Why study with us?
The Master of Public Health Programme is designed for medical or non-medical professionals interested in addressing India’s public health concerns. The programme brings together professionals from various disciplines to understand the causes of public health challenges and identify innovative solutions to improve the country’s health outcomes. If your heart is committed to improving the quality of life for communities, this programme offers excellent opportunities towards fulfilling careers.
The programme is an accelerator for early career professionals. The curriculum equips them with current and advanced knowledge and skills to contribute to research, advocacy, policy and programme. The comprehensive programme puts forth multiple perspectives helping professionals develop a sound understanding of the public health ecosystem.
Programme Structure
Good health and well-being is a fundamental right and should be accessible to all communities. Therefore, our curriculum deeply values equity, rights, and justice. What sets us apart is our programme design which is contextual, relevant and helps you understand existing and emerging public health realities and needs.
Core Courses36 credits
The core courses are designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of public health perspectives. These offer a historically grounded understanding of public health concerns, interventions (including programmatic and other responses by the state and non-state actors) and their social and ethical implications.

Despite these successful outcomes, India still faces several public health challenges, including persistent malnutrition, health risks due to environmental degradation and climate change, and non-communicable diseases, including mental health and emerging infectious diseases.
TheCOVID-19pandemic was testimony to sharp inequalities in healthcare based on class, gender, ethnicity and region. To effectively tackle India’s growing public health challenges that address social inequalities in health, there is an urgent need for public health practitioners who are committed to the social purpose of public health in the country.

Growing Public Health Concerns in India
Over the last decade, India has experienced tremendous economic growth and improved health outcomes. The reductions in the Infant Mortality Rate, Maternal Mortality Rate, improvement in Life Expectancy, and becoming Polio-free are some of the significant achievements in the public health for the country.
Despite these successful outcomes, India still faces several public health challenges, including persistent malnutrition, health risks due to environmental degradation and climate change, and non-communicable diseases, including mental health and emerging infectious diseases.
TheCOVID-19pandemic was testimony to sharp inequalities in healthcare based on class, gender, ethnicity and region. To effectively tackle India’s growing public health challenges that address social inequalities in health, there is an urgent need for public health practitioners who are committed to the social purpose of public health in the country.
Who should join us?
At Azim Premji University, join us if you are looking for a programme that aims to provide opportunities for strengthening the public health ecosystem by enabling professionals to develop a grounded understanding of public health in India embedded in a commitment to equity, rights, and social justice values. The combination of theoretical principles and continuous engagement in the field gives opportunities to students to understand the current landscape and emerging challenges in public health.
Why study with us?
The Master of Public Health Programme is designed for medical or non-medical professionals interested in addressing India’s public health concerns. The programme brings together professionals from various disciplines to understand the causes of public health challenges and identify innovative solutions to improve the country’s health outcomes. If your heart is committed to improving the quality of life for communities, this programme offers excellent opportunities towards fulfilling careers.
The programme is an accelerator for early career professionals. The curriculum equips them with current and advanced knowledge and skills to contribute to research, advocacy, policy and programme. The comprehensive programme puts forth multiple perspectives helping professionals develop a sound understanding of the public health ecosystem.
Programme Structure
Good health and well-being is a fundamental right and should be accessible to all communities. Therefore, our curriculum deeply values equity, rights, and justice. What sets us apart is our programme design which is contextual, relevant and helps you understand existing and emerging public health realities and needs.

Growing Public Health Concerns in India
Over the last decade, India has experienced tremendous economic growth and improved health outcomes. The reductions in the Infant Mortality Rate, Maternal Mortality Rate, improvement in Life Expectancy, and becoming Polio-free are some of the significant achievements in the public health for the country.
Despite these successful outcomes, India still faces several public health challenges, including persistent malnutrition, health risks due to environmental degradation and climate change, and non-communicable diseases, including mental health and emerging infectious diseases.
TheCOVID-19pandemic was testimony to sharp inequalities in healthcare based on class, gender, ethnicity and region. To effectively tackle India’s growing public health challenges that address social inequalities in health, there is an urgent need for public health practitioners who are committed to the social purpose of public health in the country.

ProgrammeMaster of Public Health
Programme
Master of Public Health
In this course, the students move from a general understanding about quantitative evidence and health measures (e.g., prevalence and mortality rates), to a deeper appreciation and competence in epidemiological concepts and methods.
The first part of the course will introduce them to the definition of epidemiology, including how to analyse and present the distribution and determinants of diseases in a specified population. This will be facilitated by reading of health reports and analysing secondary data from health and allied sectors. Students are then introduced to the range of study designs used in epidemiology (cross-sectional, case-control, cohort, experimental studies, etc.) to understand health problems, risks, and interventions in a population.
The bulk of the course will focus on cross-sectional studies, which will help build their understanding about epidemiological research questions, indicators, populations, samples, data collection, analysis, the use of biostatistical tools, inference, and reporting.
To facilitate this, they will undertake a small cross-sectional study in small groups as part of the course, mentored by the faculty member starting with how to think about the health problem being studied till the report preparation.
This will help consolidate the most relevant quantitative skills for public health practice (which can also be applied in operational research and programme evaluations).

FacilitatorMayur Trivedi

ProgrammeMaster of Public Health
Programme
Master of Public Health
While India continues to grapple with several public health challenges, it also has witnessed several efforts broadly by civil society actors in actively intervening and addressing some of these challenges. These interventions include addressing issues of community at large (such as access to care, water, sanitation, vaccination), specific groups (such as children, women, people with disability, people living withHIV/AIDS), and those that are directed at the district-state-national administration or actors in policy making at the national or international levels.
Various thought-out strategies are part of such interventions, and they vary depending on the focus, level, and context of these interventions. What do we learn from these interventions? What drives a particular intervention idea and modality? What is the theory of change that is evident in these interventions?
While students would have been exposed to community-based health interventions during their inter-semester I, the objective of which has focused on understanding comprehensive primary health care and ways of operationalising the same.
This includes appreciating the challenges, in this course, students will study and analyse a range of civil society interventions that have sought to address some of the core public health concerns through direct intervention in healthcare (for example, boat clinic in Assam), organised efforts at the community level on building community health, social accountability initiatives to demand right to health care, addressing the determinants of health or even efforts during pandemics, like the recentCOVID-19.
The objective is to understand the entire trajectory of what-why-how-what next and to draw lessons from the historical trajectory of such interventions so that students develop an in-depth understanding of how to imagine an intervention.

Biography
Mayur Trivedi has two decades of research experience in exploring self, science, system, and society across thematic areas of health financing and insurance, health economics, health and development, assessment of health interventions of government and non-government organisations, and exploration of the health of marginalised communities.
His recent research included assessments of the maternity benefit scheme (PMMVY) and government-funded health insurance scheme (PMJAY) in India. His current research focuses on health financing in India, particularly on fragmentation and covering the last mile. He works towards linking research learning to classrooms, aiming to enhance cultural sensitivities among public health students through experiential learning of social, spatial, ecological marginalization, and intersectionality.
He completed a master’s degree in health management from the Indian Institute of Health Management Research (IIHMR) Jaipur and a PhD from the Faculty of Management Studies, Delhi University. He received the Australian Leadership Award fellowship to attend the Short Intensive Professional Programme inHIVat the Sexually Transmitted Infections Research Centre, University of Sydney, Australia, in 2010.
He received a scholarship from theUCLHealth and Society Summer School on social determinants of health, University College London in 2018. Before joining the University, he has served the Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH) Gandhinagar (2008−2023) and the Institute of Economic Growth, Delhi (2003 – 2008) in various capacities.
He is a certified facilitator of a unique experiential personal and team development modular programme called Values in Health: A Spiritual Approach (VIHASA) in its online and offline formats.
Following his interest in creative writing, theatre, and filmmaking, he has developed India’s first set of television commercials on precautions against heat waves, cold waves, and thunder and lightning for the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). He published his first collection of Hindi poems, गोष्ठी / Goshthee, in 2023.

Biography
Mohit has been hiking for the last two decades with studies being his right foot and work being the left. After finishing his graduation in medicine from B J Medical College, Ahmedabad, he worked as a Medical Officer at a rural Primary Healthcare Centre (PHC) in Gujarat.
He then learnt Health Administration at Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai, and went on to work with the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) in Bihar. Following a brief stint with family planning work in Rajasthan, he joined the PhD programme at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi. He was supporting a certificate course on Public Health Practice atCAREIndia in Bihar before joining Azim Premji University.
His doctoral work focused on the understanding of Primary Health Care among the faculty of Community Medicine in medical colleges. Through in-depth interviews with the faculty, discussions with their students and observations in classrooms and field, he found that the understanding varies on two dimensions — the depth of their engagement with, and their position on, the Primary Health Care approach. Among several individual, milieu-level and structural factors found responsible for these variations, the ethos of the Institution where the faculty works was a very significant one.
He is interested in continuing his explorations in Primary Health Care approach and how it can be adopted in Medical Education.
Human Resources literally drive the healthcare system. He wishes to join voices advocating for their adequacy and quality.
Health systems have traditionally been plural. Hegemony of any one system is not healthy, and he wishes that he can make some dent there.
Humanities keep us humane, and health needs it more than any other development domain. He wants to join hands with people filling this void.

Master of Public Health
This course will introduce students as towhyandhowevidence matters for public health. It will provide the basis for what evidence is, where to find it and what to make of it.
The specific topics addressed would be: philosophy of knowledge/​​epistemology, sources of evidence (including secondary sources such as large databases, reports, health organisation and governmental websites and academic papers, local knowledge), reading of reports and papers on health problems, perceptions and interventions, the value and hierarchy of various sorts of evidence, critical thinking about claims being made, familiarising with common measures of health and disease, and appreciating how various forms of evidence is used to support public health action.

Health as Social Phenomena
What are the social factors that affect health of individuals and a community?
FacilitatorArima Mishra
Facilitator
Arima Mishra
ProgrammeMaster of Public Health
Programme
Master of Public Health
This course allows students to examine how health and ill-health are produced, experienced, practiced and promoted at the confluence of several factors and processes. Specifically, it will allow students to locate the health of individuals and populations at the intersections of biology, culture, politics, and society.
It illustrates how biomedicalised understanding of health tends to obscure multiple perspectives and experiences on health, health care and well-being. More importantly, it underplays the fact that health (including public health) is necessarily situated in society’s social, economic, and political structures, institutions, and processes.
It thus unpacks the social, cultural, political, and environmental determinants of health and explains why it is important to understand societal arrangements based on caste, class, gender, ethnicity, religion, rural, urban, and tribal to understand health and health inequalities.
It would draw on social science theories/​​concepts including social constructionism, political economy, phenomenology, (concepts including structural violence, embodiment, social suffering, vulnerability, bio-power) that have been helpful to illustrate the social and political perspectives on health.
While it would draw on global debates on social determinants of health and health equity, it would ground the discussions in the Indian context drawing on pluralistic evidence, contexts, and health conditions.

Master of Public Health
Health financing, budgeting and resource allocation are fundamental to robust functioning of public health system. Given the scarcity of resources and competing priorities, economics provides the tools for resource allocation.
The health systems are increasingly plural with both public systems and markets operating side by side. The students will critically engage with debates such as markets, market failure, purchaser-provider split, public-private partnerships (PPPs) and private finance initiatives (definitionally the actual and original PPPs) in health.
Health financing is an emerging theme under public health management. Ever-increasing health care costs continue to be one of the important causes of indebtedness among the poor and middle-income groups. All activities around health services need different forms of financing and the ways in which to pool the revenues.
With the opening of the insurance sector, the health insurance sector has been expanding into wider horizons including publicly financed health insurance schemes. Many of these schemes have been also billed as the stepping stones towards Universal Health ​‘Coverage’. Since the larger socio-economic policies influence health, the participants will also get hands-on training on understanding and analysing health budgets.

Intersectoral Approach to Public Health Actions
This course examines the relevance for intersectoral thinking, evidence and actions to environmental and other factors that impact health including nutrition, water, hygiene, and sanitation.
FacilitatorMayur Trivedi

ProgrammeMaster of Public Health
Programme
Master of Public Health
This course focuses exclusively on determinants that technically fall under ​‘other sectors’ but directly impact health. This course would help students recognise the need for inter-sectoral thinking and actions.
While in most of the cases, it is acknowledged that public health actions go beyond health sector-related interventions (history has offered enough evidence to demonstrate this) which has prompted the recent calls for ​‘Health in All Policies’, such acknowledgement does not receive serious engagement in educational programmes. Either they are offered in silos (for example, water, sanitation, and hygiene —WASH) or receive cursory treatment.
The course has two broad objectives:
The first, through a series of case studies, the course would illustrate and explain the linkages of health to select determinants including provision of safe drinking water, sanitation, nutrition, food systems and broadly, environment, including air pollution and climate change.
The second, it would encourage students to identify and appreciate the opportunities as well as challenges in inter-sectoral actions at policy, programmatic and community levels.

Master of Public Health
This course on Programme Planning, Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation addresses a core competency required of public health practice. This is because issues of public health importance including disease control, water and sanitation, nutrition, to name a few – are generally tackled in ​‘programme mode’.
Public health practitioners need to develop a grounded understanding of complex issues: public health priority setting, allocation of resources, programme design, programme implementation and programme monitoring and evaluation.
Beyond this, there is a need to be conversant with the tools and techniques required to use available evidence effectively to identify priorities and set realistic goals; build systems to generate robust data on progress towards those goals; and finally, design the most appropriate evaluation model to assess whether the programme design had the proper ​‘fit’ with the identified priority, and whether it achieved the identified goals in a timely, effective, and efficient manner.
Specifically, the course will cover:
The criticality of design and evaluation in implementation of a programme;
The manner in which conceptual frameworks of programmes and projects lay the foundation for their effective implementation.

Social Research Methods in Health: Generating Qualitative Evidence in Health
Understand the relevance of qualitative evidence for making informed public health actions.
FacilitatorsSeema SharmaArima Mishra
Facilitators
Seema SharmaArima Mishra
ProgrammeMaster of Public Health
Programme
Master of Public Health
This course attempts to delve into understanding and learning to apply qualitative methods to generate relevant evidence for a range of public health concerns. The course will take students through the entire process of framing research questions to choosing appropriate methods to data collection and analysis.
Students will be exposed to a range of tools for generating and using qualitative evidence — verbal data (interview techniques,FGD), textual data (organisation newsletters, reports) and visual data (photo voice) and their juxtapositions as and when needed to engage with a range of public health issues and sites (formative research to process documentation to monitoring and evaluation). They will learn to appreciate the relevance of qualitative evidence for informing public health actions.
Students would also draw insights from the use of participatory tools in their PracticeIIengagement. While learning different research approaches and methods (epidemiological, qualitative, participatory), students would appreciate how these have their own strengths and relevance depending on nature of questions/​​problems investigated and not necessarily in opposition to each other.

ProgrammeMaster of Public Health
Programme
Master of Public Health
This course enables students to understand and critically examine the complex interconnections between health policy and systems. Health systems have traditionally been understood as technical institutions delivering ​‘health care’ services, the course will encourage students to engage with the developments in the field in understanding the complexities of health systems and policies that include not only the ​‘hardware’ (human resources, services, medicine and technology, organisational structure, services etc.) but also the ​‘software’ (ideas and interests, relationships and power, values and norms, social and political contexts at different levels- local-global) as well as the process/​​functioning of health systems (devolution of power, accountability/​​regulation, community empowerment, etc.)
Students would learn how health policies and systems have evolved with shifting narratives of calls for Health for All-Universal Health Coverage – Health Assurance- Health in All Policies and its implications. They would examine different health systems frameworks to locate public health issues.
The course would also examine different health systems reforms and strengthening efforts in response to these shifting policies. Far from a linear, value-neutral, apolitical process, students would also understand the politics of the policy-making process in unravelling the role of actors and contexts in shaping policies.

Master of Public Health
This course aims at introducing students to understanding and examining public health by interrogating what is ​‘public’ and ​‘health’. It would help students appreciate why values of equity, social justice and human rights areintrinsicto public health and its implication on public health practice.
It encourages students to engage with questions: What does a population/​​community orientation (contrasted with an individualised orientation in clinical medicine) of public health entail? Why do values matter in public health? Who is responsible for public health – state, society, individual? What does ​‘health’ in public health entail? How do we situate the tension between focus on disease-centred care and comprehensive health and wellbeing (physical, mental, and social wellbeing) that includes preventive, promotive and rehabilitative care in public health?
How do we address and resolve fundamental conflicting ethical principles/​​values that affect public health practice and decision making (For example, individual freedom vs common good, market vs social justice, equity vs efficiency)? How is health situated in the broader development imagination of Indian society? What are some of the defining moments in history that have informed our understanding of what public health is and what are their implications in contemporary contexts?

Growing Public Health Concerns in India
Over the last decade, India has experienced tremendous economic growth and improved health outcomes. The reductions in the Infant Mortality Rate, Maternal Mortality Rate, improvement in Life Expectancy, and becoming Polio-free are some of the significant achievements in the public health for the country.
Despite these successful outcomes, India still faces several public health challenges, including persistent malnutrition, health risks due to environmental degradation and climate change, and non-communicable diseases, including mental health and emerging infectious diseases.
TheCOVID-19pandemic was testimony to sharp inequalities in healthcare based on class, gender, ethnicity and region. To effectively tackle India’s growing public health challenges that address social inequalities in health, there is an urgent need for public health practitioners who are committed to the social purpose of public health in the country.
Who should join us?
At Azim Premji University, join us if you are looking for a programme that aims to provide opportunities for strengthening the public health ecosystem by enabling professionals to develop a grounded understanding of public health in India embedded in a commitment to equity, rights, and social justice values.

Why study with us?
The Master of Public Health Programme is designed for medical or non-medical professionals interested in addressing India’s public health concerns.

Growing Public Health Concerns in India
Over the last decade, India has experienced tremendous economic growth and improved health outcomes. The reductions in the Infant Mortality Rate, Maternal Mortality Rate, improvement in Life Expectancy, and becoming Polio-free are some of the significant achievements in the public health for the country.
Despite these successful outcomes, India still faces several public health challenges, including persistent malnutrition, health risks due to environmental degradation and climate change, and non-communicable diseases, including mental health and emerging infectious diseases.
TheCOVID-19pandemic was testimony to sharp inequalities in healthcare based on class, gender, ethnicity and region. To effectively tackle India’s growing public health challenges that address social inequalities in health, there is an urgent need for public health practitioners who are committed to the social purpose of public health in the country.
Who should join us?
At Azim Premji University, join us if you are looking for a programme that aims to provide opportunities for strengthening the public health ecosystem by enabling professionals to develop a grounded understanding of public health in India embedded in a commitment to equity, rights, and social justice values. The combination of theoretical principles and continuous engagement in the field gives opportunities to students to understand the current landscape and emerging challenges in public health.
Why study with us?
The Master of Public Health Programme is designed for medical or non-medical professionals interested in addressing India’s public health concerns. The programme brings together professionals from various disciplines to understand the causes of public health challenges and identify innovative solutions to improve the country’s health outcomes. If your heart is committed to improving the quality of life for communities, this programme offers excellent opportunities towards fulfilling careers.
The programme is an accelerator for early career professionals. The curriculum equips them with current and advanced knowledge and skills to contribute to research, advocacy, policy and programme. The comprehensive programme puts forth multiple perspectives helping professionals develop a sound understanding of the public health ecosystem.
Programme Structure
Good health and well-being is a fundamental right and should be accessible to all communities. Therefore, our curriculum deeply values equity, rights, and justice.

Abstract
While the recentCOVID-19pandemic has accentuated attention to the public health challenges of our times, many of these concerns are certainly not new. There are multiple public health concerns including the rising burden of non-communicable diseases, health risks due to environmental degradation and climate change, and re-emergence of several communicable diseases. Responses to these challenges, including educational responses, have often been reductionist and hence found to be inadequate. There has been an increasing global recognition of the need for transformative education to address the complex health challenges of the 21stcentury. In this article, we discuss one such effort in designing apublic health education programmein India that echoes the sentiment of transformative learning that is contextual, competency-driven, trans disciplinary, reflective, and collaborative. We discuss how these aspects of learning were reflected and considered through a series of internal deliberations within the university and external consultations with different stakeholders. This process involved examining existing gaps in public health education, articulating the core competencies, developing the curriculum, and envisaging students’ contribution to public health practice in India.

Biography
Mukta is a public health researcher interested in exploring how social conditions influence health. She is especially interested in understanding how social and gender inequalities intersect to impact adolescents’ health indicators.
Most recently, Mukta worked as a technical specialist with Population Council, New Delhi. She co-led baseline data collection for a community-based evaluation for a programme aimed at skilling in-school and out-of-school adolescent girls to reduce the incidence of child marriage in Rajasthan.
Her research work included contributing to an evidence synthesis of experimental studies from South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa that were aimed at delaying marriage, reducing teenage pregnancies, and improving labour force participation among adolescent girls and young women. She also co-authored research briefs, analysed data, designed research tools, and supervised data collection.
Mukta earned her doctoral degree in Public Health from Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IITGandhinagar) in 2020. Her doctoral research focused on understanding the social determinants of menstrual health among adolescents across urban, rural and tribal settings in Nashik district, Maharashtra.
Her doctoral study on menstrual health included both adolescent girls as well as boys as she explored how gender itself acts as a social determinant to influence adolescents’ knowledge, beliefs, and communication regarding menstruation using a mixed-methods approach. Prior to her doctoral journey, she worked withIITGandhinagar as a Research Associate.
She completed her master’s degree in Public Health from Indiana University Bloomington in 2013 and her bachelor’s degree in Physiotherapy from Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS), Nashik in 2008. After completing her bachelor’s degree, she worked at Society for Education, Action and Research in Community Health (SEARCH), Gadchiroli as a fellow.
She looks forward to expanding her work on school climate and its impact on various adolescent health indicators.
Besides work, she loves Indian classical dance and enjoys reading Marathi literature.

Field experience is integrated into the programme structure, offering students opportunities for immersive, real-world experiences, thus helping students apply classroom learning to address fundamental organisational issues in social sector organisations.

While the core courses cover foundational aspects of management, students will also get to explore some of their areas of interest beyond what the core courses offer. A few such courses will be offered as electives in the fourth term. The participants can choose three electives of two credits each from a basket of courses. An indicative list of electives is given below.

Field Practice10 credits
The programme ensures that learning is embedded in real-world contexts – both communities and organisations. While the core and elective courses will help build the perspectives, competencies and intellectual curiosity of the students, field engagement is crucial for developing sensitivity and empathy, while also honing skills in managing organisations. This experiential learning is facilitated through two components:
A two-week long field immersion
An eight-week long internship in a social sector organisation
Classroom Practices
The classroom practices in our programme are designed to ensure an inclusive and immersive learning experience, blending theory with hands-on practice. The programme uses a diverse mix of lectures, group discussions, peer learning, audio-visual materials, and case studies to make complex concepts accessible to students from a wide range of academic and socio-economic backgrounds and work experience.
Group work is a key aspect of the programme, emphasising the importance of collective learning and collaboration. Field experience is integrated into the programme structure, offering students opportunities for immersive, real-world experiences, thus helping students apply classroom learning to address fundamental organisational issues in social sector organisations.
Many courses feature guest lectures from sector experts and practitioners who bring contemporary, real-world insights into the classroom. Our faculty members are highly accessible, offering additional support during office hours.
Career Opportunities
The programme will prepare students to be future leaders of social sector organisations, responsible to all stakeholders in the society. Some opportunities for transformative career shifts and possible career trajectories include:
Leading the implementation of large programmes in social sector organisations
Facilitating organisational growth through people management and fundraising
Playing a leadership role in the rapid growth environment of social enterprises, large cooperatives and farmer producer companies
Managing programme grants at donor foundations, philanthropies andCSRteams
The University has a strong track record in placements and 100+ organisations recruit our students every year, including leading national and international non-profits,CSRfoundations, development consultancies, and impact-driven enterprises.
A dedicatedPlacement Cellprovides comprehensive support, training, and career guidance, helping students navigate their professional journeys with confidence. Additionally, theSocial Enterprise Cellsupports those interested in launching their own impact-driven ventures.

While the core courses cover foundational aspects of management, students will also get to explore some of their areas of interest beyond what the core courses offer. A few such courses will be offered as electives in the fourth term. The participants can choose three electives of two credits each from a basket of courses. An indicative list of electives is given below.

The programme ensures that learning is embedded in real-world contexts – both communities and organisations. While the core and elective courses will help build the perspectives, competencies and intellectual curiosity of the students, field engagement is crucial for developing sensitivity and empathy, while also honing skills in managing organisations. This experiential learning is facilitated through two components:
A two-week long field immersion
An eight-week long internship in a social sector organisation
Classroom Practices
The classroom practices in our programme are designed to ensure an inclusive and immersive learning experience, blending theory with hands-on practice. The programme uses a diverse mix of lectures, group discussions, peer learning, audio-visual materials, and case studies to make complex concepts accessible to students from a wide range of academic and socio-economic backgrounds and work experience.
Group work is a key aspect of the programme, emphasising the importance of collective learning and collaboration. Field experience is integrated into the programme structure, offering students opportunities for immersive, real-world experiences, thus helping students apply classroom learning to address fundamental organisational issues in social sector organisations.
Many courses feature guest lectures from sector experts and practitioners who bring contemporary, real-world insights into the classroom. Our faculty members are highly accessible, offering additional support during office hours.
Career Opportunities
The programme will prepare students to be future leaders of social sector organisations, responsible to all stakeholders in the society. Some opportunities for transformative career shifts and possible career trajectories include:
Leading the implementation of large programmes in social sector organisations
Facilitating organisational growth through people management and fundraising
Playing a leadership role in the rapid growth environment of social enterprises, large cooperatives and farmer producer companies
Managing programme grants at donor foundations, philanthropies andCSRteams
The University has a strong track record in placements and 100+ organisations recruit our students every year, including leading national and international non-profits,CSRfoundations, development consultancies, and impact-driven enterprises.
A dedicatedPlacement Cellprovides comprehensive support, training, and career guidance, helping students navigate their professional journeys with confidence. Additionally, theSocial Enterprise Cellsupports those interested in launching their own impact-driven ventures.

One key management function in a social sector organisation is to manage finance. It is done at two levels: one of accounting, and the other of managing the finances of the organisation. This coursewill focus on the latter. The course will assume that the actual accounting work will be done by the accountants in the organisation, but the managers need to have a good understanding of the finances of the organisation and the direction in which it is moving.
The course will deal with understanding and interpreting financial statements through the lenses of prudence, efficiency, risk, and sustainability. (While participants will need to learn some broad concepts and principles of accounting such as the general ledger, trial balance, cash and accrual-based accounting, and expense norms in projects, teaching accounting is not the aim of the course). By the end of the course, the participants will learn key principles of financial management. Social organisations are also of different types: not-for-profits, cooperatives, and companies, each of which requires somewhat different ways of accounting, which the participants should be familiar with. In addition, norms for the use of foreign funds will be dealt with in the course. The participants also have an understanding of audit and compliance requirements

Development, construed as improving human and social conditions, based on equity and justice has been a key priority of the Indian state. It embraced a modern economy, modern education and modern political and social institutions to chart the path of development. However, the journey has not been smooth in the last 75 years, to say the least.
The course will deal with the nature of Indian society, its major cleavages of caste, class, patriarchy, religion, and ethnicity, their intersectionalities, along with the nature of its political and social institutions, the skewed structure of power, and weak civil society which contributes to the challenges. The course will also deal with major development ideas the Indian state experimented with, such as community development, poverty alleviation, reservations, and the neoliberal paradigm. It will also offer an understanding of alternative development ideas which are alive and thriving. . The course is expected to help the participants appreciate the complexities and multiplicities of development challenges they would confront as part of SSOs.

In this course, participants will be exposed to the different organisation designs and structures relevant to the social sector (simple, functional, divisional, hybrid, matrix). The objective is to help managers understand what design is appropriate for which type of organisation. They will also learn why organisations adopt a particular structure that fits in with their stage of growth and their specific goals and working approach.
Participants will then be able to link the organisational structure to the culture and ethos that, in a way, defines an organisation. They will also learn to articulate which traits are desirable for supporting development work, such as clear roles and responsibilities, sensitivity to life circumstances of staff members, inclusive and ethical processes (decision-making and operational), ability to work collaboratively (internally and externally), reflect critically and adapt to changing ground realities and funding scenarios. Participants will learn how to build and maintain such organisational cultures and the common challenges faced in such efforts.

Management professionals in social sector organisations will have to deal with qualitative and quantitative data and analysis in the context of organisational needs. This may be to support projectdesign, do an exploratory search to understand a local situation, capture changes on the ground quantitatively and qualitatively, and present data to external stakeholders.
There are two courses in this programme intended to develop competencies for the participants to grasp local and non-local realities from data (both quantitative and qualitative) and its analysis. Understanding Data for Decision Making is a foundational course to build general analytical skills. It will help participants understand what evidence is and what its relevance is in the context of SSOs. It will then introduce different types of data and how they are collected. Using several thematic datasets, participants will learn to do simple aggregation, disaggregation, and interpretation of the data to develop an understanding of a local situation. In doing this, the participants will also become familiar with various available data sets and their usage for organisational purposes. This will sensitise them to identify and work with data appropriate for decision-making. The course will also briefly deal with the limitations of different types of data.

Social sector organisations often engage with the state at the local, district, state, and even national levels. This may be in the context of advocacy, leveraging state programmes, ensuring rights andentitlements, addressing grievances, or working in partnership with some organ of the state. Therefore, the participants need to have a basic understanding of the institutions and the systems ofgovernance. This course provides a rounded introduction to the state institutions and governance including its vertical and spatial distribution. This will be located within the federal structure of development governance as espoused in the Constitution. The focus will be on the development functions of the state at the district level and below. It will include the structure and functioning of the Panchayati Raj Institutions and the development administration to show how a frame of collaborative governance mechanism is at play at the local level. In addition, the course will deal with the various ways local democratic governance is conceptualised and designed in forest andPESAareas in managing local resources. A discussion on the diverse ways of effective engagement of the citizenry with the state will run through the course.

Development actions are typically based on certain normative positions, shared goals, practical experiences, and agreed theories of change. Often these follow the established frameworks ofstate-driven redistributive welfare, community-driven culturally embedded local solutions, or market opportunity-driven individual welfare. The course aims to enable participants to analytically frame a development problem using the established normative positions and frameworks, and also several alternative solutions or interventions which emanate from them. It will show how thesenormative positions and frameworks can lead to multiple possibilities of interventions within each of them and in combination with one another. For instance, ensuring household food and nutrition security can result from public procurement and distribution, market penetration, household production or any innovative combinations of these. The course will leverage a few such thematic areas and examine different approaches of framing the problem and interventions by state and non-state actors. Through this, the course will help participants appreciate and analyse the similarities, differences, challenges and opportunities offered by each of the alternate approaches and sharpen their ability to frame and imagine different kinds of action spaces which may rely on different approaches or their combination.

Early career development management professionals are often part of teams that manage specific project activities within larger programmes, and in many cases, also multiple projects acrossthematic verticals at the same time. While programmes and projects are often used interchangeably, our focus here will be on projects and not so much on the overall interventions as programmes. This course will help participants grasp the full life-cycle of projects, from conceptualisation to planning,budgeting, implementation, monitoring and reporting. This skill-oriented course will stay focused on project planning and implementation, post the project design stage. Managing multipleprojects simultaneously on the ground requires the capacity for planning and execution at a very granular level and skills related to resource allocation, financial planning, optimisation and dealingwith contingencies. Participants will also understand relevant concepts (log frame-based targets) and get better at using common tools (MSOffice for plan vs achievement tracking, budget utilization, team and donor reporting) across the project lifecycle. Overall, the course would enable a participant to manage the day-to-day execution of the project tasks in the most efficient manner (short-term), while also effectively fulfilling the project goals (medium-term).
