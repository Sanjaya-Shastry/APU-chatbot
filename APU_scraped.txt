Engagement
Full-time
As we know, the world is facing considerable challenges of environmental change and sustainability. There is a real and growing need for a programme that helps students develop a strong understanding of environmental science and its interlinkages with sustainability, grounded in the Indian context.
A key feature of the BSc in Environmental Science and Sustainability (
ESS
) at Azim Premji University is its inherently interdisciplinary focus.
Students will obtain an integrated understanding of environmental change, through a lab and field-based hands-on approach to learning about environmental change, exposure to real-life examples and interacting with faculty members engaged in cutting-edge research on exciting new problems.
Through this, students of
ESS
will develop a strong foundation of environmental science; understand its linkages with human behaviour, economy and policy; learn how to conduct qualitative and quantitative research on the environment; and end with a strong focus on environmental action to achieve change on the ground.
We admit students from all streams, including science, social science and the humanities, and believe that diversity and interdisciplinarity is a key strength of this programme.
Who should join us?
Science is necessary to address environmental challenges that we face today. But a scientific view is insufficient by itself, as environmental impacts are shaped by political decision-making and influenced by local social and cultural contexts.
Our
ESS
programme engages with environmental issues that require attention globally, and specially in the Indian context, by contributing to your knowledge, developing the ability for critical thinking and building skills oriented towards finding solutions.
Why study with us?
We offer Interdisciplinary Openness
Our programmes encourage you to explore and follow your interests. We design our courses to ensure that you can specialise in a subject of your choice while learning various subjects across disciplines.
A Common Curriculum for all students
You will meet all your classmates at the beginning of your course to build all the tools you need for your four years of study. This includes foundational courses, an understanding of India, interdisciplinary studies, and courses in
creative expressions
.
We provide Academic Assistance
Our consistent academic assistance through language support, peer tutoring, faculty mentorship, etc., ensures that you meet the programme’s academic requirements.
We ensure Financial Support
We extend need-based financial assistance to students that cover tuition and accommodation expenses.
Programme Structure
Course Structure
Common Curriculum
The Common Curriculum will introduce students to the study of the themes and areas that emphasise and build critical and analytical abilities, and sensibilities for dialogue, reflection and cooperative learning. The Common Curriculum has four sub-components organised as below:
Academic Reading and Writing:
Introduces students to domain specific reading and writing skills
Creative Expressions:
Students are empowered to participate with meaningful social connection, fostering a community of active and responsible citizens
Public Reasoning/​​The World of Computing:
The students will do one of the two courses.
Public Reasoning: Introduces students to the practices of understanding as well arguing for claims in the public realm.
The World of Computing: This enables students to explore the potential of computing devices and computational reasoning
Understanding India:
India’s history, society and possible future.
Disciplinary Major
The core of the BSc in Environmental Science and Sustainability major curriculum will focus on helping students develop a strong understanding of environmental science, enabling students to appreciate the interactions between geological, chemical, physical, and biological processes that shape the earth’s environment.
Building on this core understanding of environmental science, the curriculum will further introduce students to a range of research analytical methods, both qualitative and quantitative, and to methods of environmental analysis.
Alongside, they will take courses that expose them to concepts and methods of environmental economics and policy, as well as environmental communication, and action. The below lists the required courses a student in the major will take with each course being of five credits. Students doing the
ESS
major will be encouraged to do either an internship or a research project on sustainability.

Campus Biodiversity Documentation
Second-year students of BSc in Environmental Science and Sustainability did a campus bioblitz, as part of a course, collecting information on flora and fauna on campus. They looked at trees, peered into the undergrowth and rooted in the leaf litter. The species were identified using citizen science apps and the data collected was uploaded along with pictures.
The bioblitz was aimed at encouraging students to turn into citizen scientists and contributing to collecting baseline data on the campus biodiversity. It was also a lot of fun!

The National Education Policy (
NEP
), 2020 of India proposes full participation of children with diverse learning needs in the regular schooling process.
Children with disabilities educated in regular schools outperform those educated in segregated settings. Inclusive school environment benefits all children, not just those with disabilities.

Participants will then develop ideas and practices that can better include children and implement the same to assess if the ideas better include children. The demonstration of ideas is done through construction of lesson plans, assessment structures or any other relevant medium. Overall, participants will assess current practices to understand the level to which they are inclusive in nature and will seek to further develop, reflect and reassess the practices for its inclusivity.

Examples of innovative inclusive practices adapted by some schools across the country will be presented. Partnering with NGOs working with children with special needs, in-service teacher training, creating inclusive spaces for the teachers, students and support staff, providing a wide range of extra-curricular opportunities are some of the practices adapted by these schools. The use of inclusive index (based on
SWIFT
Education Centre) in evaluating and developing inclusion practices in school will be introduced. Additionally, it will cover the process of evaluation and enrolment of students with diverse abilities keeping in mind the school contexts in terms of resources, the expertise and infrastructure that are available to provide support.

Azim Premji Foundation
Our story
Education for social change
Azim Premji Foundation
Contributing to a just, equitable, humane and sustainable society.
The Foundation’s vision is to contribute towards a more just, equitable, humane and sustainable society. Its work is focussed on India.
Azim Premji
set up the Foundation in 2001. Over the past years, he has irrevocably donated most of his wealth to fund the philanthropic work of the Foundation. As a part of the endowment created by these donations, along with other assets, 66% of the economic ownership of Wipro Ltd is with the Foundation.
Foundation
​
‘
on-the-ground’
The Foundation does extensive and deep
​
‘
on-the-ground’
work
across the country – both directly through its
own operations
and through
partners
. The work spans education to other important areas of equity and human wellbeing.
Foundation’s Field Institutions
The Foundation works on improving the equity and quality of the
school education
system in India, with a focus on the more disadvantaged areas of the country. The work ranges from
teacher capacity development and leadership development
to matters of
policy
and curriculum, including a significant contribution to the National Education Policy (
NEP
) 2020 and National Curriculum Framework 2023.
The Foundation’s Field Institutions are spread across 7 states and 1 Union Territory which have over 3,50,000 schools. In addition, the Foundation also works deeply with 7 states in the northeast of the country and selectively in many other (currently 5) states. There are 59 institutions in the field working with these school systems. The Foundation also runs 9
schools
for
​
‘
demonstration and training’.
The Foundation’s own team of over 1700 people in the Field is spread across 263 locations.
The Field Institutions are in some of the most disadvantaged districts of India, each staffed with 10 – 60 members. The Foundation also runs 263
​
“
Teacher Learning Centres”, in these districts.
This deep institutional presence is now being leveraged by the Foundation to work on
Health
,
Livelihoods
, and a few other key initiatives (mentioned below), starting with a few regions and then expanding.
Partners:
The Foundation supports over 1000 other not-for-profit organisations (NPO
s
) across the country with multi-year grants and selectively with corpus
grants
. These NPO
s
do deep
​
‘
on-the-ground’ work across a range of issues — supporting people who are severely disadvantaged and marginalised with immediate care, access to essential services, and the possibility of a dignified future. Such support to partners is also growing rapidly.
Some of these vulnerable groups are urban poor, persons with disability, women facing violence, adolescent girls at risk, children at risk, homeless, elderly poor, manual scavengers, migrant workers, farmers with marginal landholding, particularly vulnerable tribal groups and water-deficient communities.
This work also involves collaboration with state governments and groups of NPO
s
to address issues systemically — beyond immediate care and support. Some such collaborations are: in Odisha, an effort to improve nutrition and hygiene; in Andhra Pradesh, improving the livelihood of small and marginal farmers; a multi-state programme to strengthen local governance and
Panchayati Raj
institutions; in Tamil Nadu, setting up centres in district hospitals to rescue, treat and rehabilitate mentally ill homeless individuals; supporting access to the judicial system for the vulnerable.
Universities
The Foundation is building a network of its own universities to contribute to capacity development and research for the social sector.
The first
Azim Premji University
was set up in Bengaluru in 2010 and today operates from a 110-acre campus. The second one, i.e.,
Azim Premji University, Bhopal
, started in 2023 in a 50-acre campus. The work on the third campus in Ranchi has started on a 150-acre site, and this will be operational by 2026 and subsequently a fourth campus in the northeast part of India, is planned.
Azim Premji University has been offering degree programmes since 2011. Its mandate is to run teaching programmes and conduct research to contribute to the social sector in India, and to be an exemplar higher education institution – with inclusion and quality.
The masters, diploma, and short duration programmes are focused on domains of human development; for example, Education, Livelihoods, Development, Governance and Policy, Public Health, and Sustainability. The undergraduate programmes offer a broad-based liberal education – integrating the fields of human development that are the focus of the University.
The research programmes are designed for direct contribution to matters of policy and practice, in these very fields of human development, for example, through dedicated research centres on Employment, Climate Change and Local Democracy (
Panchayats
).
Capacity development of civil society and public system professionals is a key priority for the University. We offer a range of programmes in critical areas like early childhood education, inclusive education, disability, assessment, educational leadership, social sector leadership, and local democracy, reaching over 1 lakh practitioners annually.
The University produces a large collection of teaching-learning material for free public use. These include magazines in school subjects, development case studies, online textbooks, translations of higher education material, etc.
The Foundation’s on-the-ground operations and the University integrate real grassroots and systemic knowledge to contribute to policy, research and continuing education.
Twelve cohorts of over 4300 students from the programmes have graduated from the University and almost 100 percent of the students from the master’s programmes have received job offers on campus. Nearly 90 percent of these students have chosen to work in the social sector — many in grassroots field locations across the country.
The Universities are entirely philanthropic; currently 89 percent of the expenditure is borne by the Foundation. Currently, about 60 percent of students are on scholarships offered by the University. The student body is very diverse, from across 29 states and varied socio-economic backgrounds.
Health
While the Foundation contributes to a large range of domains and issues of human wellbeing as mentioned, over 20 years of direct work in
School Education
has built deep expertise in that domain and is now building
Health
as a similar domain of expertise and contribution.
The work in Health has started in Bengaluru and in the states of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. This work will strengthen the public health system — where required complementing and supplementing it — including running primary health clinics, secondary and tertiary hospitals.
The
Master of Public Health programme
at the Bhopal campus is an initial step in contributing towards development of capacity in the Heath sector. At the Ranchi campus, a
medical college with its associated 550-bed tertiary hospital
will be set up. Plans include setting up two more such medical colleges and hospitals.
In addition to our own work in Health, the Foundation is collaborating with several partners – including hospitals and NGO
s
— to make healthcare accessible to vulnerable communities and to improve community health across a much larger geography.
New initiatives
The Foundation is also in the initial phases of a
few other significant initiatives
, associated or adjacent to our work in Education and Health, which could contribute deeply to human wellbeing. Some of the key initiatives are:
Strengthening the
nutritional content of mid-day meals
for children in government schools and Anganwadis by providing an egg (or its substitute) every day to every child. This project, first implemented in Karnataka, is benefitting over 55 lakh children, will be rolled out across multiple states over the next 2 years.
Setting
up and running creches in rural areas
for infants and children under the age of 3 in some of the remotest geographies. The first 675 creches are operational in Odisha, Jharkhand, and Chhattisgarh.
Scholarships
for support of higher education of
girls across India
—starting with 30,000 scholarships in 2024 and going up to 2,50,000 scholarships in the academic year 2025 – 26.
A
national Youth Programme
to support development of young people to do constructive social work, manifesting the values of our Constitution. Currently the programme has about 1.25 lakh young people in about 3000 youth groups.
In a few geographies, intense work has been started to
improve significantly the livelihoods of those in poverty
. The challenge is to help foster local economic development in these
​
‘
livelihood regions’, such that there is a substantial increase in overall value in the local economy, thus enabling significant increase in household level incomes — equitably, with ecological sensitivity, and responding to the aspirations of local youth populations. Our own operations have been initiated on this in a few blocks in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, which will expand, and the initiative will expand to other regions in collaboration with our partners.

Assessments constitute an integral part of the teaching-learning process. At present assessment is seen as an evaluative exercise that focuses on measuring a very limited range of abilities in students. The primary purpose of assessment is to support learning, and to provide a holistic view of students’ abilities and progress towards fulfilling the aims of education.
In such a context, there is a pressing need to move towards competency-based assessments that are focused on enhancing students’ higher-order thinking skills, such as analytical ability, critical thinking, and creativity. This in turn would require practitioners ranging from teachers, teacher educators, school leaders, education functionaries and other specialists in the field to have a holistic understanding of the domain of educational assessments.
The Postgraduate Diploma in Education- Educational Assessment to be offered by Azim Premji University aims to build capabilities among key stakeholders by providing knowledge, skills, values and dispositions that are necessary for planning, designing, and utilising assessments in order to bring about a positive shift in the culture of assessments.

Snippets from the various field engagements of our students
Why Community Engagement Initiative?
To use the knowledge and expertise of the University, Field institutes of Azim Premji Foundation, and the Philanthropy arm of the Foundation to contribute to improving human conditions and sustainability in the villages around the campus.
To provide opportunities for students, the University and the rest of the foundation members to contribute and learn from the community engagements.
To build a harmonious relationship between the University and the villages around the campus.
Our external community
The
University
is located in the Burugunte village of Billapura Panchayat, Anekal taluk, Bengaluru. Currently, we engage with 9 Gram Panchayats around campus: Billapura, Handenahalli, Sarjapura, Mugaluru, Yamare, Dommasandra, Muthanallur, Neriga and Bidaraguppe.
These Gram Panchayats consist of 40 villages and 23 wards, with a population of 1.9 lakh, constituting a substantial portion of migrant labourers, farming communities, and petty businesses that are dependent on surrounding industries and residential apartments.
There are 2 Primary Health Centres (PHC
s
) and 8 Health sub-centres in the neighbourhood of the campus.
Further, 46 government schools, 7 panchayat libraries, and 2 veterinary hospitals are also present in this geography.
Furthermore, there are around 50 lakes in these Gram Panchayats ranging from 10 acres to 200 acres in size.
Current Engagements
Community Learning Centre (
CLC
)
We provide academic support to more than 20 children of our support staff and a few community children on our campus during the weekends. Along with activity-based learning sessions, the children also have exposure to the university resources. The sessions are primarily facilitated by our student volunteers with support from our University members.
Creating a stable market for local farmers
We have launched a weekly ​“Vaarada Santhe” at the University. In collaboration with the Sarjapura Farmer Producer Organisation, we are working in transforming our consumer producer collective into a vibrant open market. Every week, a farmer producer group from Mugaluru Panchayat brings their fresh produce to our stalls, offering a wide range of vegetables, fruits, organic leafy greens, millets, jaggery, wood-pressed oils. This initiative also invites local Self Help Groups (
SHG
) to sell delicious ready-to-eat products and offers a live food counter for the university community. Through this initiative, over ₹2 lakh has been raised to directly support farmers, reinforcing our commitment to sustainable livelihoods and community engagement.
Empowering panchayat libraries
CEI
has been engaging with the 28 libraries of Anekal taluk in activities such as monthly reflection and planning meetings, workshops and training, events like Kannada Rajyothsava, Children’s Day, and other national/​state important days.
CEI
also organised computer literacy programmes, community awareness programmes, setting-up of children’s corner, on-site support, books arrangement, enhancing aesthetics in the neighbouring panchayat libraries as part of the overall engagement to activate these spaces for local children, youth and other community members. The objective is to revitalise and re-energise the rural public library spaces.
Empowering sustainability through culinary collaboration: A new frontier with local SHG
s
The Sustainability Committee, in collaboration with the Community Engagement Initiative, has disseminated comprehensive guidelines for organising sustainable events on campus. A standout recommendation from these guidelines was to foster collaboration with local SHG
s
, particularly in the realm of catering. This approach not only advances the University’s sustainability objectives — such as reducing environmental impact and encouraging local sourcing — but also contributes meaningfully to the economic empowerment of women in nearby communities.
Contributing to University events
Taking an active role in University events, we partnered with
SHG
members to cater food for various university functions. More than 100
SHG
members enthusiastically participated in a range of events organised by the University (Idea Challenge Event, World Education Forum, Unmukt, Social Enterprise Mela, and so on) showcasing our commitment to community involvement. To date, SHG
s
have successfully catered to 187 events on campus, collectively generating an income of around
INR
24 lakhs.
Capacity Development and Involvement of
SHG
members in Community activities
Our engagement extends beyond individual initiatives as
SHG
members actively participate in community development activities. These include cleanliness drives, celebrations of important days, and drives to enhance school enrolment within the community. Over 250
SHG
women from the neighbourhood Panchayat participated in workshops focused on improving financial literacy, entrepreneurial skills, leadership skills. Thirteen women entrepreneurs working in sectors such as food production, paper bag making, floriculture, agriculture, and tailoring have received targeted support to expand their ventures, including linkages facilitated through the Smile Foundation. In response to local demand, tailoring courses were organised in Bidaraguppe and Mugaluru, where 60
SHG
women successfully completed a five-month training programme. Furthermore, 12 women entrepreneurs — both individuals and groups — have actively participated in initiatives such as the National Social Enterprise Idea Challenge, weekly markets, and university fairs, showcasing their business ideas and gaining valuable exposure and networking opportunities.
Engagement with youth
The youth empowerment efforts in Dommasandra and surrounding areas have made a positive impact through various programmes. These include the
Mountains of Life
, which engaged 30 youths, enhancing their learning and participation, and
Spoken English Classes
at the local library, improving language skills for 14 participants. With the linkage of
SAN-IT
Centre,
we worked with over 15 youth to develop computer, communication and leadership abilities. The
National Social Enterprise Idea Challenge
exposure visits inspired 22 youths with leadership skills. Collaborations with local youth groups, such as the
Vijaya Sarathi Youth Group
and others in Dommasandra, Mugaluru, and Handenahalli, promoted cultural, educational, and skill-building activities. The
SVP
College Youth Group
fostered creativity through arts, music, and theatre, encouraging future development.
Empowering women and youth through language, skills, and fitness
Sustainability Committee in collaboration with the Community Engagement initiative, has recently disseminated comprehensive guidelines for organising sustainable events on campus. A standout recommendation from these guidelines was to foster collaboration with local SHG
s
, particularly in the realm of catering. This strategic decision not only aligns with our sustainability goals but also plays a crucial role in supporting the livelihoods of local women.
Launch of community disability intervention
University’s disability team along with the Community Engagement Initiative and in collaboration with the Sarjapura Primary Health Centre (
PHC
) has crafted interventions to support members with disabilities in the community. We aim to bring about an inclusive system in the community and institutions we work with. Following screening, interventions will commence to provide rehabilitation services and referrals.
Launch of mental health services at Dommasandra
PHC
Our University’s Centre for Positive Mental Health and Wellbeing (Conversations) team is now offering mental wellbeing sessions at Sarjapura
PHC
to the community service providers in collaboration with the local health team since January 2024. We have initiated the patient screening, prioritising patients with chronic stress and vulnerable community groups suffering from diseases like tuberculosis and cancer. The team launched 8 sessions on activity-based experiential approach to work with Accredited Social Health Activitists (ASHA
s
) using expressive art therapy and narrative practices. We will soon move to group sessions for community members to expand the support. We will also empower the frontline workers with training to identify mental health concerns in the community.
Promoting responsible waste management practices
We are collaborating with a partner organisation (Hasiru Dala) at Billapura Gram Panchayat to create a zero waste Panchayat in the Anekal Taluk. Waste collection centre has been established at Billapura and it is functional as of January 2025. Gram Panchayat functionaries along with representatives are trained on their respective roles and responsibilities of the intervention, on a regular basis. We also take them on various site visits for exposure and understanding. We aim to create a sustainable model by involving the Gram Panchayat Level Federation (
GPLF
) to run the initiative in order to create livelihood opportunities.
Social security and entitlement drives
We work closely with the marginalised communities in and around the University. With the aim to build a safety net for informal workers on campus and vulnerable communities in the neighbourhood, we are trying to create an enabling environment by providing awareness about various government programmes and schemes.
CEI
has organised several outreach drives in the villages around the University. Further, we have facilitated drives to enrol 1600 community members for schemes such as e‑Shram, Ayushman Bharat Health Account (
ABHA
) and Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Yojana.
CEI
has also enrolled 70 support staff of the University in
ESI
, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (
PMJJBY
), and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (
PMBSY
).
Strengthening local democracy
We have completed the pilot phase of our initiative aimed at strengthening local democracy in Billapura Panchayat. We worked to fortify sub-committees within the Panchayat, fostering a more robust and efficient organisational structure. Identifying and empowering 60 second-line leaders has been a pivotal step in enhancing the Panchayat’s leadership network. Through targeted capacity training, we expect these leaders to be better equipped to address the challenges faced by the community.
We facilitated training of Panchayat representatives, ensuring they are well-versed in their roles and responsibilities. This initiative is instrumental in fostering a more informed and proactive local governance. We also facilitated in organising for a Gram Sabha in October 2024. This event witnessed the active participation of over 100 key stakeholders who voiced their concerns and challenges. Since July 2024, Community Resource Persons (CRP
s
) have mapped more than 100 common ecological resources in 4 gram panchayats to establish asset registers.
Bridge programme around our neighbourhood
We have initiated a Grade X support programme at Sarjapura High School with the help of the District Institute team and the concerned school authorities. Our university members have volunteered to take up classes in subjects such as Social Science and English on a weekly basis. The purpose of this program is to provide additional academic support to the class 10 students for their upcoming board exams.
Along with this, we conducted craft
&
art, clay and constitutional education sessions at Attibele government school. The plan is to have more such sessions in other government schools in our neighbourhood with the help of our
DI
team and volunteers.
Research in community and service learning courses
Our research strategy is a methodological approach in which knowledge is generated for practical intervention purposes as well as academic discussions and community
​
‘
ownership’ is encouraged. Current projects are:
“
Entrepreneurial Ecosystem in Anekal Taluk: An exploratory research project”, to pilot a few micro-enterprises in our neighborhood.

Part-time
About 5 to 15 percent of children in classrooms in India have a learning disability. Policies mandate that all children need to be part of the regular school system, irrespective of their learning needs. But due to lack of awareness and poor implementation of the policies, children with disabilities are often forced to drop out of school. Teacher preparedness is critical for ensuring that children with learning disabilities become a part of an inclusive school system.
The Postgraduate Diploma programme in Teaching Children with Learning Disabilities aims to equip teachers to understand the nature and characteristics of the condition as well as possess the necessary knowledge to adapt the curriculum and modify teaching strategies to help the children cope with the demands of a regular school curriculum and become lifelong autonomous learners.
Enabling teachers with the required skills and knowledge helps develop competencies needed to function as effective inclusive school teachers, thereby fostering their professional growth in the workplace.
Who should join us?
This postgraduate diploma is open to practicing regular school teachers, special educators, counsellors and school heads working in private and public school systems in India.

Learning Disability: Teaching Methods and Strategies
10 credits
In this programme the participants will learn about evidence-based practices for enhancing information processing abilities, social emotional behaviour and academic achievement of children with Learning Disabilities
Course 1: Intervention for Children with Learning Disability — An overview
This course emphasizes that the integration of professional wisdom with the best available empirical evidence in making decisions about how to deliver instruction is very important to help children with learning disability in a classroom. The course provides the participants of the programme with an understanding of the importance as well as the different perspectives and available models for evidence-based practices in intervention for children with learning disability.
Course 2: Instructional Strategies in the Curricular Areas for Children with Learning Disability
It provides guidelines to the learners in using specific teaching strategies and approaches for specific curricular areas in which children with
LD
face learning difficulties.
Course 3: Intervention: Social, Emotional and Behavioural Issues
The course discusses approaches to effective management of challenging behaviours within the classrooms and otherwise. In addition to creating a safe and calm learning space, participants will also learn how to deal with emotional outbursts and challenging behaviour of students. Using an empathetic lens, teachers will try to unpack the social and emotional regulation difficulties of these students by identifying the underlying skills they are lagging.
Course 4: Project based course — - Learning Disability: Teaching methods and Strategies
This certificate programme will help general education class teachers work with children having learning difficulties to help them achieve optimal learning outcomes. The courses in the programme prepare teachers to plan and apply appropriate intervention strategies in different curricular areas as well as support their social-emotional learning. It will also inform teachers to help children use learning strategies to become more purposeful, effective, and independent learners. Through this project, the participants will observe the learning environment, the curricular and pedagogical practices, teaching learning materials, and analyse how they address the needs of all children including those with learning difficulties. Some themes that will be explored in this project include teaching aids for the intervention of children with learning difficulties, including assistive technology, public awareness resources, policies regarding the accommodation of children with Learning Disability, etc. The participants will be mentored by the programme instructors.

Course 2: Universal Design of Learning and Differentiated Instructions

Early childhood education plays a critical role in the holistic development of young children and in building a strong foundation for their school education. The National Education Policy (
NEP
) 2020 has proposed several measures to achieve universal provisioning of quality early childhood development, care, and education.
The need for well-trained preschool teachers and functionaries of early childhood education is paramount considering the very large population of children in the 3 – 8 years age group in the country.
The Postgraduate Diploma in Early Childhood Education is a programme that aims to fulfil the need for professional development in this field. The Programme not only aims to build capability of the teachers to create a more significant impact in their workplace but also develop skills and knowledge to help improve job prospects.
You have the flexibility to enrol in individual certificate programmes that align with your practice. If you wish to deepen your learning, you can begin with a certificate programme and later, choose to convert to the one-year
PG
diploma in Early Childhood Education. This will enable you to progress at your own pace and tailor your learning journey as per your career goals.

200 Metres From Glory — Rita Gombu Marwah’s Story
In 1984, Bachendri Pal became the first Indian woman to conquer Mount Everest. Rita Gombu Marwah, from a renowned mountaineering family, was part of the same expedition.

Almost Perfect — Stories Of Forgotten Indian Women Athletes
While some soar to stardom, others remain in the shadows despite their exceptional talents. Welcome to Almost Perfect, a captivating series that unearths the remarkable yet often overlooked stories of Indian women athletes
Why ace archer Chekrovolu Swuro bowed out
Chekrovolu Swuro, the talented archer from Nagaland, represented India at the 2012 London Olympics. Followers of the sport may remember that she had competed in the same team as Deepika Kumari, the teenage sensation who rose to great heights. Despite culminating in defeat, Swuro’s story of resilience continues to enthuse aspiring archers. Listen to

Game. Set. Mismatch. No love lost for Archana Venkataraman
In the 1990’s, Archana Venkataraman was a star on the rise. Since she was four, her tennis-obsessed family shuttled her from one tournament to another, one coaching clinic to the next. At seventeen, she was crowned the National Champion. Her place did not go unchallenged. At the finals of the National Games in 2002, Archana came up against a younger, hungrier, grittier rival — 16-year-old Sania Mirza. Playing the newcomer on her home turf in Hyderabad and booed by a hostile crowd of spectators, Archana went down in a firestorm of deuces. It takes a lot to succeed in a sport as expensive and competitive as tennis, more so for an Indian woman. In over a century, only four  have made it to a Grand Slam event. Viewed in that sobering light, Archana Venkataraman’s story is one worth telling. Listen to it on Almost Perfect.

Our Bhopal Campus
Our Bengaluru Campus
Student Support
We nurture an inclusive community that makes a safe space for different points of view, ideas, and people to grow together.
Academic Resource Centre (ARC) ﻿
The
ARC
coordinates and curates several programmes across the University to facilitate comprehensive academic support that addresses the diverse needs of students in our University. The support is tailored to address specific subject areas or academic challenges across the University.
Senior students also co-facilitate these programmes as tutors (pre-admission bridge programme), peer tutors (peer tutoring programme) and volunteers (summer and winter bridge programmes).
Language Learning Development Centre
At Azim Premji University, we understand that English is not the first language of many students from across the country. Though most courses are taught in English, we strive to ensure that students who are incipient learners of the language are not disadvantaged in the classroom or any campus space. To help students ameliorate their proficiency in English, the Language Learning Development Centre conducts weekly sessions that focus on grammar, diction, reading and writing to equip students with basic understanding of the language such that it does not hinder in their academic progression.
Peer Tutoring
Peer tutoring is a system on campus wherein students facing academic difficulty in a particular course are guided by senior students of the same major. The senior students can adequately give tips, clarify concepts and suggest reading material for better understanding and performance by the tutee in the classroom. Some tutors are assigned individually to students, some host open houses to clarify doubts that students may wish to comprehend outside the formal classroom space. Peer tutoring establishes a great connect between juniors and seniors and is a space for regulating pace of conceptual and technique based learning.
Faculty Mentors
Each student is assigned a faculty mentor at the beginning of their stay. Faculty mentors are faculty members who have weekly sessions with their mentee groups
(each mentee group consists of not more than five students)
to discuss any academic obstacles, complaints or any issues on campus that the student might face. Mentors act as academic guardians for students and help them structure their academics and extracurriculars, looking out for their well-being on campus.
Anti-Ragging, POSH and policies against bullying
Each year Azim Premji University admits a broad range of students from different socio-economic backgrounds, sensibilities and experiences in life. To make sure that everybody on campus feels safe, the university has strict anti-ragging policies and a
POSH
committee that strictly, efficiently and anonymously deals with any sort of sexual or any other sort of bullying or harassment. Students can approach members of this committee or certain faculty members to lodge a case against anybody who is present on campus. All spaces in the university always strive to be open spaces with no power dynamics playing out that would make students feel disadvantaged. The Student Body and Resident Mentors are also involved in ensuring the safety of students
Discrimination
Justice and equity are fundamental guiding principles of the University. Any form of discrimination based on religion, caste, gender, sex, community, beliefs, disability or any other factor unrelated to academic requirements is contrary to our principles.
Sexual Harassment
We nurture an environment based on respect for individual dignity and space. Sexual harassment is unwelcome sexual conduct, unwelcome acts of physical intimacy, unwelcome oral or textual requests for sexual favours, graphic representations of a sexual nature, and other visual, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. We pro-actively build awareness on this issue and offer
counselling services
with regard to sexual attitudes and behaviour.
We have a sensitive and strong redressal process for sexual harassment in accordance with the Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) at the Workplace Act of 2014. All members of the University, irrespective of gender and sexual orientation, can seek redressal against sexual harassment at the University.
If you have any questions, concerns, clarifications, or wish to file a formal complaint, please feel free to get in touch with any member of the PoSH Committee or write to
posh@​apu.​edu.​in
.
Bullying, Intimidation and Ragging
We nurture an environment in which every individual is ensured of her right to live with dignity and respect and is free from vulnerability to any kind of bullying, intimidation or
​
‘
ragging.’ We work proactively towards prevention of such practices and provide a sensitive and strong system of redressal in the event such incidents occur.
Details of National Ragging Prevention Programme are enclosed
here
Summer Programme and Winter Programme
These are additional programmes conducted during semester breaks that students usually attend before their courses begin. The Summer Programme students are introduced to the campus space, life in Bangalore, their peers and the faculty beforehand and spend time strengthening the core concepts of their chosen course, embellishing speaking and writing skills and other foundational requirements to get a head-start in their academic journey.

Azim Premji Foundation
Our story
Education for social change
Our story
We have unusual origins.
In early 2000, Azim Premji Foundation set out to work in the field of elementary education in government schools across India. The Foundation hoped to contribute to improve the quality of education of India at a deep and institutional level in close partnership with the government.
Over the years, the Foundation set up district-level institutes that worked to improve the capacity of teachers, school leaders, teacher educators and administrators in public education.
A decade of grassroots work generated critical insights into the challenges and opportunities on the ground. The biggest need of the hour was for well-qualified professionals in the social sector.
Azim Premji University was set up in response to this need in 2010. We began with two programmes in
education
and
development
, along with courses for working professionals that enhanced the capacity of those who already work in the field.
Azim Premji University was founded in 2010, with the vision to contribute to the realisation of a just, equitable, humane and sustainable society.

Cross State comparison of Excess Deaths During the Covid Pandemic in India: Some Measurement and Methodological Considerations
in
Azim Premji University
CSIE Working Paper Series
Published
2025
Authors
More
Abstract
This paper assesses excess mortality in India during the
COVID-19
pandemic, focusing on the year 2021 when the country experienced a substantial surge in deaths. Drawing on newly released official data from the Civil Registration System (
CRS
) and the Sample Registration System (
SRS
), and supplemented with estimates based on the National Family Health Survey (
NFHS
‑5), we construct a range of mortality estimates using multiple baseline comparisons. Excess deaths are calculated in absolute terms, per 1,000 population, and using age-standardised death rates to facilitate cross-state and international comparisons. Particular attention is paid to persistent challenges in India’s mortality data landscape, including regional disparities in death registration completeness, limitations in cause-of-death certification, and inconsistencies between administrative and survey-based sources. The analysis includes alternative projections that adjust for estimated registration completeness, underscoring the sensitivity of mortality estimates to underlying data assumptions. By applying standard demographic techniques such as age standardisation, we attempt to mitigate the effects of India’s heterogeneous age structure and registration coverage. The findings suggest a substantial mortality impact from the pandemic, exceeding officially reported figures, and raise broader questions about the capacity of statistical systems to support real-time health surveillance. We identify correlates in terms of state capacity.These results have implications for public health preparedness, intergovernmental coordination, and the long-term strengthening of civil registration and vital statistics systems in India.

Blue Food: A Perspective Aligned with Adoption of Sustainable Development Goals
in
Springer Nature
Published
2025
Authors

Mohit Sharma
More
Abstract
The increasing global demand for food, coupled with the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation, has shifted attention towards blue food systems. While these systems offer a potential solution to food security challenges, their sustainability is threatened by various factors, including overfishing, habitat destruction, and climate change. Recognising these challenges, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (
FAO
,
UN
) advocates for ensuring the sustainable contribution of aquatic food systems to global food security and nutrition, aligning with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs). It was hypothesised that adoption of UN-SDGs would increase the interest of researchers in sustainability of fisheries and aquaculture. Therefore, a bibliometric analysis of the relevant literature published between 2000 and 2023 was conducted to test this hypothesis. The analysis revealed a significant rise in publications addressing climate change and sustainability after the adoption of the UN-SDGs. The countries exhibiting high vulnerability to climate change contributed disproportionately fewer publications to the database. The United States emerged as the leading contributor in terms of publication volume, while Canada’s University of British Columbia was identified as the institution with the highest number of contributing authors. The findings underscore pronounced geographical disparities in research output, with a predominance of countries from the Global North. The underlying factors contributing to these disparities are discussed. Furthermore, the study discusses the policy implications of these findings and emphasises the imperative to prioritise equitable research initiatives. Such efforts are essential to effectively support the realisation of the SDGs within the domain of blue food systems and sustainability.

Rural Multidimensional Deprivation in Jharkhand: A Data-Driven Analysis 2024
in
Azim Premji University
Published
2025
Authors
School of Development
More
Abstract
This report constructs a Rural Multidimensional Deprivation Index (
RDI
) for measuring deprivation in Jharkhand. An important feature of the index is that it is constructed using indicators on provisioning of basic infrastructural amenities at the village level. This is different from the usual poverty indices that are composed of financial indicators such as income or consumption; or indicators measuring development outcomes such as educational or nutritional levels. Observing the provisioning of basic infrastructural amenities, this report makes focused policy suggestions that can be easily implemented by functionaries working on the ground. The data for the index is sourced from the Mission Antyodaya Survey, which was carried out in 2019 at the village level across the country. The survey collects data related to provisioning and outcome of basic amenities in villages, along with demographic and socioeconomic variables. Because this is a periodic survey, it enables us to track the developmental progress of each village, district, state and the country over time. In total, there are about 182 variables that were captured in the 2019 round. The survey covers 31,175 out of 32,620 villages in Jharkhand, which is 95.6 percent of the total number of villages in the state; and 6,48,358 out of 6,67,933 villages in India, or 97.1 percent of the villages in the country.

Building Capabilities of Informal Workers by Recognition of Prior Learning: The Current Practice and Alternatives
in
Azim Premji University
Published
2025
Authors
Centre for Sustainable Employment
More
Abstract
Recognition of Prior Learning (
RPL
) is a key pillar of India’s Skill India mission under the National Policy for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (
NPSDE
) 2015, aimed at formalizing the skills of its vast informal workforce, which accounts for over 91% of total employment. By bridging the gap between experiential learning and formal certification,
RPL
has the potential to enhance employability, economic mobility, and workforce productivity. However, India’s
RPL
implementation faces significant challenges, including regulatory misalignment, limited industry adoption, and low stakeholder awareness, along with logistical barriers such as evidence verification and assessment costs. Primarily certification-driven, it lacks integration into the vocational training system, limiting its effectiveness as a pathway for skill advancement and higher income. Moreover,
RPL
is often used as a shortcut to boost certification numbers rather than as a tool for meaningful skill development. This paper examines the evolution, implementation, and impact of
RPL
in India using national labor force survey data while benchmarking it against global best practices from countries such as South Africa and the
UK
. The study identifies key policy gaps and proposes strategic recommendations to strengthen
RPL
, ensuring it transitions from a certification-centric model to a robust mechanism for workforce inclusion, quality vocational education, and sustainable skill development.

The Historical Evolution of Caste and Territorial Power: The Case of Jats in Punjab, India
Published
2025
Authors
Awanish Kumar
More
Abstract
This article presents a historical account of emergence and development of the territorial power of Jats in Punjab through analysing three elements. First, their historical appropriation of the village as their agrarian territory, which was often perpetuated under the discourse of
​
‘
village community’/clans and the monopolisation of the peasant identity. Second, the often-benevolent administration in Punjab during the colonial rule. Third, the development of a discourse of caste-progressiveness of Jats. The Punjab experience in this regard is significant to understand similar processes in other states and to make appropriate strategies for social movements and policy advocacy regarding agrarian/​social reforms.
Résumé
Cet article présente un compte rendu historique de l’émergence et du développement du pouvoir territorial des Jats au Pendjab en analysant trois éléments. Premièrement, leur appropriation historique du village en tant que territoire agraire, qui s’est souvent perpétuée sous le discours de la « communauté villageoise »/​clans et de la monopolisation de l’identité paysanne. Deuxièmement, l’administration souvent bénévole du Pendjab pendant la période coloniale. Troisièmement, le développement d’un discours sur la progressivité de la caste des Jats. L’expérience du Pendjab à cet égard est importante pour comprendre des processus similaires dans les autres États et pour élaborer des stratégies appropriées pour les mouvements sociaux et le plaidoyer politique concernant les réformes agraires/​sociales.

What is the value of value for agrarian studies?
in
Journal of Agrarian Change
Published
2025
Authors
School of Arts and Sciences
More
Abstract
Reflecting a longstanding intellectual heritage in Marxist political economy, contributions to agrarian studies have variously referred to the production, distribution and extraction of value. Despite this central role within the heritage of agrarian studies, the concept of value is often used inconsistently between authors and sometimes deployed without clear elucidation of the underlying theoretical tenets. As such, value often tends to be used more as a metaphor suggestive of conditions of exploitation rather than a detailed conceptual framework. In response, we must ask if there is still a robust case for value analysis forming a foundational pillar of agrarian studies? To address this challenging question, we invited three authors to give their perspective on the value of value for agrarian studies. First and foremost, we asked them to consider what value analysis does that is otherwise missed in critical agrarian studies and how we can mobilise its potential to sharpen analyses. Two further pivotal questions arise, spurred on by recent trends in the literature. First, to what extent do the categories of value enrich or hinder our evolving understanding of the dynamics of social reproduction within agrarian households and communities, including the gendered relations through which agriculture and livelihoods are performed? Similarly, are the largely anthropogenic concepts of value fit for the purpose of explaining environmental change and the more-than-human dynamics through which agricultural landscapes are produced and change over time?

Methodological Holism in Marx’s Capital Volume 1: The Conceptualisation and Measurement of Individual Units
in
Sage Journal
Published
2025
Authors
More
Abstract
This article aims to understand the methodological position that Marx takes in
Capital
Volume 1 and the implications of that on the individual units in his analysis. With the understanding that Marx adopts a fundamentally holist methodological standpoint, the article outlines how the individuals within classes and the system of capitalist production are measured and contextualised. This question is answered by examining Marx’s
Capital
Volume 1 as the primary text. Where relevant, the author engages with Marx’s intellectual background and tradition. The individual units discussed in this study are the commodity, the worker and the capitalist.
This article examines how the concept of the representative individual emerges through averaging and how this process unfolds in Marx’s
Capital
, shaped by his methodological approach. The article illustrates the method of averaging in Marx, through his intellectual engagement with Quetelet as it also focusses on Hegel’s influence on Marx’s method and elaborates on the parallels and divergences between them. With the given engagement with
Capital
and Marx’s intellectual interactions, we arrive at a specific understanding of holism that can be attributed to Marx in
Capital
Volume 1.

Abstract
“
Global learning crisis” narratives, in focusing on the
​
“
proximate determinants” of the crisis, represent a welcome
​
“
classroom turn” in international education and development. Extant learning crisis literatures are problematic, however, as their homogenizing gaze distorts how teachers and students co-constitute classrooms as locally meaningful learning spaces. Drawing on anthropological approaches in comparative education, this article addresses the
​
“
learning crisis” in a middle-school classroom in a weavers’ neighborhood in Kanchipuram. Constituted in an elaborate
​
“
notebook economy,” this classroom was an inventive response that not only accommodated students’ material cultures and social-educational disadvantages but also affected their belonging in a resource-scarce public education system. If the learning it afforded was disdained in
​
“
learning crisis” narratives, it was nevertheless relevant for students, readily translated into educationally unintensive assembly-line jobs. In producing contempt for such classrooms,
​
“
learning crisis” narratives merely distract from — and thus entrench — the deeply unequal economic and educational development that necessitated the notebook economy in the first place.

Recent allopolyploidization and transcriptomic asymmetry in the mangrove shrub Acanthus tetraploideus
in
Springer Nature
Article
Published
2025
Authors
More
Abstract
Background
Mangrove species are vital to the ecosystems of tropical and subtropical coastlines worldwide. Despite the underexplored role of polyploidization in these species, deciphering its impact on gene expression is essential for understanding the connection between polyploidization and species diversification. Our initial investigation, integrating multiple nuclear loci with morphological and cytological data, indicates that the tetraploid
Acanthus tetraploideus
likely originated from allopolyploidization events involving the diploid species
A. ilicifolius and A. ebracteatus
. Expanding on these insights, this study utilises genome-wide evidence to confirm the divergence patterns among extant
Acanthus
mangrove diploids and to investigate the origin and transcriptome asymmetry of the tetraploid
A. tetraploideus
.
Results
Phylogenetic analysis and molecular dating revealed a closer evolutionary relationship between
A. ebracteatus
and
A. volubilis
than between
A. ebracteatus
and
A. ilicifolius
, diverged approximately 6.92 Mya and 9.59 Mya, respectively. Analysis of individual whole transcriptomes revealed that homeologous sequences in
A. tetraploideus
were preferentially clustered with
A. ilicifolius and A. ebracteatus
, rather than
A. volubilis
, in a roughly 1:1 ratio. The high similarity in nucleotide sequences and homologous polymorphisms between the tetraploid
A. tetraploideus
and its two parental diploids,
A. ebracteatus
and
A. ilicifolius
, supports the hypothesis of a recent allopolyploid origin for
A. tetraploideus
. Estimation of homeolog expression revealed a general attenuation of homeolog expression divergence in
A. tetraploideus
compared to the in silico parental mix, with 22.87% and 67.66% of genes exhibiting biased homeolog expression, respectively. Further investigation identified remarkable retention of parental expression dominance in the tetraploid, suggesting that parental genetic legacy substantially influences the reconfiguration of homeolog expression in the derived tetraploid. Meanwhile, the observation of numerous novel expression patterns between the two homeolog sets suggests that the transcriptome shock (i.e., the transcriptomic changes induced by interspecific hybridisation) associated with allopolyploidization and subsequent post-polyploid evolutionary processes also significantly impact transcriptome asymmetry in
A. tetraploideus
. While no strong evidence directly links transcriptomic changes to specific adaptive traits, the patterns in unbiased and novelly biased genes in
A. tetraploideus
suggest adaptations to stable polyploidy. Unbiased genes involved in fundamental cellular processes and novelly biased genes related to chromosome dynamics and cell cycle regulation may stabilise polyploid genomes, supporting the species’ establishment and long-term success. These findings underscore the role of transcriptomic stability in polyploid adaptation.
Conclusions
Our study sheds light on the evolutionary origins and the intricate transcriptional reconfiguration of the tetraploid
A. tetraploideus
. These insights significantly enhance our comprehension of the pivotal role that polyploidization plays in speciation and adaptative evolution of mangrove species.

Gendered inclusions and exclusions: Intersectional media discourses during the pandemic in India and the
USA
in
Springer Nature
Published
2025
Authors
More
Abstract
The
COVID-19
crisis created a period when an otherwise globalised world witnessed the rapid closure of local, national and international borders. Migrants, whose everyday lives, with or without the pandemic, are disrupted and defined by borders and their liminalities, were the most certain victims of these closures. All media platforms around the world reported on migrant workers, either villainising them as carriers of the virus or sympathising with them as victims of continued racist assaults and ruthless state policies. But what discourses dominated these media representations of migrants? Analysing over one thousand news reports on migrant precarity in India and the
USA
during the first two years of
COVID
, we see some patterns of gendered inclusion and exclusion. We find that even the seemingly pro-immigrant media discourses continued to emphasise migrants’ vulnerability, turning them into feminised props for larger political debates. In the process, the economic contributions of migrants across skill categories and often as
​
‘
essential workers’ remained invisible. The discourses also reproduced intersectional stereotypes, sometimes completely removing women, and often selectively magnifying or erasing their racial, ethnic and caste identities.

Capitalism, Competition and Class Conflicts: A Pedagogical Introduction to Marxist Political Economy
in
Sage Journal
Article
Published
2025
Authors
Srishti Yadav
More
Abstract
This article offers an introduction to Marxian economics for the uninitiated student or instructor. It first places Marxian economics within the surplus approach and ties Marx’s economic analysis with his theory of history, that is, historical materialism. The concepts of class, mode of production and antagonism are introduced. The article then discusses Marx’s analysis of capitalism. This is performed by first introducing the reader to the labour theory of value and then to the circuit of capital. The conflict between capital and labour and the conflict between capital and capital are explored around the question of technological change and innovation. This is followed by a brief discussion of the capitalist crises in the Marxian framework, after which the article concludes by presenting two strands of debate within Marxian economics.

Ecosystem services in the Alps: visitors’ perceptions of two alpine protected areas
in
Taylor & Francis
Published
2025
Authors
More
Abstract
Understanding users’ perception of natural areas and their ecosystem services is crucial for managers and policy makers as it directly informs decisions that balance conservation efforts with public acceptance. The alpine areas are particularly vulnerable to climate change, making it critical to understand how visitors perceive these areas to develop management strategies that minimize conflicts, helping to ensure long-term support for environmental protection. This study explores the perceptions of 21 ecosystem services – including cultural, regulating and provisioning services – among visitors of two protected alpine areas in Italy. We distributed 3,399 questionnaires to evaluate visitors’ perceptions of the importance of key ecosystem services, their awareness of the ecosystem services concept and any shifts in perception due to
COVID-19
, as the study took place during an ease of restrictions caused by the pandemic. Additionally, we explored the relationship between perceptions and demographic factors. Results showed that visitor strongly perceived the importance of the aesthetic value of the landscape and biodiversity conservation. Perception of the overall importance of
ES
was strongly correlated with demographic factors, such as gender, age and a connection to outdoor and naturalistic activities. Visitors who were already aware of the
ES
concepts exhibited higher perceptions compared to those who did not acknowledge them, suggesting the need for targeted communication strategies to extend the awareness of the
ES
concept. This data provides critical insights for managers and policymakers to tailor communication efforts, fostering greater public awareness and support for the benefits provided by protected natural areas.

MGNREGA
as a Technological Laboratory: Analysing Wage Payment Delays as a Result of Two Digital Interventions
in
Springer Nature
Published
2025
Authors
More
Abstract
The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (
MGNREGA
) is India’s rural employment guarantee programme that provides 100 days of work to each household and mandates payment of wages within 15 days of completion of work.
MGNREGA
has been subject to many technological interventions purported to improve efficiency and transparency. Many of these interventions were introduced without any consultation or scientific piloting resulting in violation of workers’ rights. We focus on two digital interventions. Firstly, in the financial year 2021 – 22, wage payments of workers were segregated based on their caste. Notwithstanding delays in wage payments, we find there is a statistically significant difference in the time taken to process payments across caste. This provides an empirical corroboration of how this move created caste tensions at worksites. Just in our sample, the compensation as per law that is payable to workers due to delays by the union government alone is ₹399 million. This is neither acknowledged nor paid. Secondly, we demonstrate that there is no statistically significant difference either in timely payment of wages or in payment rejections between the Aadhaar-Based Payment System (
ABPS
) and the standard account-based methods. Our analysis is based on 31.36 million transactions across 10 states from financial year 2021 – 22 crawled from the programme’s Management Information System. This is the first large-scale data-based evidence debunking officially stated claims of timely payments due to
ABPS
. We also examine official government circulars, documents retrieved using Right to Information responses combined with our immersive fieldwork to underscore our findings. In summary, we argue that any digital technology introduced in
MGNREGA
or any other social policy must be done through a consultative process, independent audits, giving centrality to workers’ rights.

Abstract
Some experts consider
​
“
food” as the most critical issue of the 21
st
century. Countries such as India are experiencing what has been described as a triple burden of malnutrition – characterised by high prevalence of undernutrition, obesity, and micro-nutrient deficiency. These are a result of inadequate access to healthy foods, increased use of highly processed foods, and low dietary diversity, besides factors related to sanitation. Changes in the practice of agriculture has resulted in a reduction in agrobiodiversity. The challenges to accessing food during shocks such as the
COVID-19
pandemic and conflicts in various parts of the world demonstrated the importance of local food security and reminded people of the importance of local food sources, including uncultivated or wild foods.

Lattice Engineering Triggered Phase Formation of Bimetallic Thiospinels with Excellent HzOR and
OER
Activity for Energy-Efficient Hydrogen Production
in
ChemCatChem
Published
2025
Authors
More
Abstract
Introducing foreign elements into a crystal lattice could trigger phase transformation, serving as an excellent means to fabricate highly electrocatalytic phases. NiCo2S4 is a notably electrocatalytic thiospinel phase, normally synthesized via two-step route and rarely explored for electrocatalytic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). This work reports one-step hydrothermal syntheses of NiCo2S4 and CuCo2S4 and their performance for HzOR and oxygen evolution reaction (
OER
). Time-dependent syntheses suggest formation of (M, Co)
9S8
; M=Ni/Cu phase, followed by conversion to the respective thiospinel phase. Computational study validates that the incorporation of Ni into Co9S8 disrupts its stability and induces the formation of a stable bi-metallic thiospinel phase. Even without the assistance of metal foam substrate, NiCo2S4 displayed remarkable activity for HzOR requiring potentials of 153 and 350 mV to afford current densities of 10 and 500 mA/​cm2, respectively. Furthermore, NiCo2S4 showed good activity for
OER
, providing 10 mA/​cm2 at 290 mV. For hydrazine-assisted
H2
production, the two-electrode setup, NiCo2S4||Pt/C attained a current density of 10 mA/​cm2 at 140 mV, which is 1.39 V less than that required for conventional water electrolyzer (1.53 V). Long-term durability of NiCo2S4 for both HzOR and
OER
at high current densities highlights the suitability of the catalyst for practical applications.

Accumulation by Dispossession: Evidence of Shrinking Space for Small-scale Fishers of Karnataka Coast
in
Springer Nature
Published
2025
Authors
More
Abstract
Small-scale fisheries play an important economic, social and cultural role in coastal Karnataka even today despite being subjected to several natural and anthropogenic stressors for a long time. They are neglected or even outright discouraged in the state’s fisheries policymaking, and their contributions to the state’s fish supply and their role in livelihood creation do not receive the due recognition. This paper is premised on the recognition of emerging stressors that pose a threat to the viability of small-scale fisheries. The impacts of these stressors have implications not only for the environment but also for nutrition, particularly among vulnerable populations, and the overall socio-economic stability of coastal communities that rely on fishing as a livelihood. The goals of this paper are to provide a thorough review of literature around these stressors, and to describe how these are being played out in coastal Karnataka. Among these stressors, we delve in depth on the new Blue Economy policy of India since it is likely to have severe antagonistic effects in combination with other anthropogenic stressors. Our opinion is, Karnataka has already started witnessing many of these ramifications of interventions/​stressors and the coastal landscape of the state is set to be transformed over the next couple of decades or so. Small-scale fisheries of the state are likely to be some of the most impacted communities from these interventions.

Household energy choices under fuel stacking scenarios: evidence for bundling welfare schemes for facilitating clean fuel use
in
IOP Publishing Ltd
Published
2024
Authors
More
Abstract
Energy poverty related to a reliance on traditional biomass for cooking has a strong association with environmental degradation, gender inequity and human health. Reduction of energy poverty is a growing concern in public policy agenda globally. In India, the last decade has seen concerted efforts to provide clean cooking fuel to the population. Despite this, wide regional disparities in energy poverty exist in India, indicating differential regional impacts of policies. A shift to universal access to clean modern cooking fuel requires the redesign of policies, with insights from a decentralized understanding of actual drivers of household cooking energy choices across diverse regions. The paper attempts to explain household cooking fuel choices under multiple fuel use (fuel stacking) scenarios in two states of India, differentiated by their socio-economic status and development trajectories. The paper employs multinomial logistic (
MNL
) regression on household level data from the Indian Human Development Survey 2015 to identify factors determining fuel choices. Urbanization,
per capita
income, the educational attainment of the household head and women in the household, having a separate kitchen for cooking and not living in one’s own house were observed to be positively influencing a switch to clean cooking energy in both the states. The results of the study indicate that shifting out of energy poverty and achieving the goal of universal clean cooking energy would require combining ongoing welfare policies with policies on provisioning clean cooking energy in India.

The Ontological Choreography of Conservation Practice at a Marine Turtle Rookery in India
in
Conservation and Society
Published
2024
Authors
More
Abstract
The Rushikulya beach in eastern India is considered to be an important rookery (nesting site) for a species of migratory marine turtle, the olive ridleys
Lepidochelys olivacea
, because it is one of a handful of sites around the world where an arribada or mass-nesting event occurs. During an arribada, thousands of ridleys nest simultaneously over a small section of the beach, and several weeks later, millions of hatchlings emerge from these nests and crawl into the sea. Given the uniqueness of this phenomenon, conservation programmes have emphasised the monitoring and protection of ridleys during an arribada. In Rushikulya, this involves an assemblage of multiple actors, including biologists, their local assistants, and staff of the Odisha Forest Department. In this article, I use the concept of ontological choreography, drawn from multispecies scholarship, to focus attention on how members of this assemblage bring together different ontological orders, mainly nature and the individual self, to protect the ridleys. Further, I use this concept to direct attention to the hybrid nature of conservation practice — that it can simultaneously be affective, embodied, performative, sensory and technical. Overall, this article demonstrates how multispecies approaches can enrich social studies of conservation.

The programmes at Azim Premji University encourage research in more ways than one
Do you think you can differentiate between an ant and a spider? Are you curious about studying the structure of milk? Do you want to image super thin nanofilms? Get to the core of instrumentation and build affordable microscopes. Learn to build your own equipment and set up your own experiments, rather than using ready-made ones that often serve as nothing more than a black box.
Find resources that wouldn’t drown you in the depths of scientific concepts and learn to read and interpret complicated texts in colourful, engaging ways.

Social Enterprise Cell
Social Enterprise Idea Challenge
9th National Social Enterprise Idea Challenge
Social Enterprises established by our Alumni
Social Enterprise Mela
Social Enterprise Cell
A platform to encourage students to find innovative solutions to some of the most complex social problems that we face in the world today.
Our Social Enterprise Cell was set up in 2015 to enable our students to share, debate and discuss their ideas. It also helps them network with individuals, incubators and like-minded groups towards creating their own social ventures.
The cell is anchored by a University member, with the support of others who form a core group. Interested students from each batch volunteer, plan and organise all our yearly activities.
Our Objectives
Our objectives align with our University’s explicit social purpose.
To promote awareness about social entrepreneurship among our students as a tool for social action
To nurture and guide entrepreneurial initiatives of our students and alumni
To act as a resource centre for the social enterprise ecosystem in India through various events, programmes and publications.
We believe that our primary purpose is to make a social impact by solving critical and complex societal problems on the ground.
Activities
We conduct various structured workshops and small capacity building programmes for our students which involve people from the University and external resource people. Some of the workshops are about design thinking, finance and budgeting of organisations, proposal writing, communication and outreach as well as organisation building.
We organise regular on-campus interactions with young budding social entrepreneurs, some of whom are our own alumni. The invitees share their journey and struggles with interested students.
In the coming years, we intend to nurture the matured ideas of recent graduates as well as alumni to provide providing mentoring and non-financial support.
In 2016, we launched a national level Social Enterprise Idea Challenge event for college and University students across India.

Our Recruiters
I have had the good fortune of working with young graduates of the
MA
in Development programme of the Azim Premji University for over a decade. The University instils in young professionals a certain sense of purpose, and provides them with the initial grounding needed to work in community focussed rural development. There are two qualities that stand out among the youngsters from Azim Premji University: a sense of intellectual humility and willingness to explore new lessons; and the ability to work in difficult physical and emotional settings.
Liby T Johnson, Executive Director, Gram Vikas

About
The Working Paper Series provides a platform for members of the university to document and publish their wide-ranging research work, experiences in implementation of programs and development of processes.

Papers in this series undergo two rounds of rigorous review (comprising an internal review and an external review) before they are published.
Objectives
The objective of the working paper series is to:
Cultivate a practice of structured documentation and effective and quicker communication of a diverse spectrum of disciplinary and cross-disciplinary work.
Disseminate this body of work to a wider audience through free online access as well as in print.
Why write for the Working Paper Series?

Fond recollections, bittersweet memories, or markers of a forgotten past? uncultivated foods in rural Chintamani, Karnataka

Abstract
Some experts consider
​
“
food” as the most critical issue of the 21
st
century. Countries such as India are experiencing what has been described as a triple burden of malnutrition – characterised by high prevalence of undernutrition, obesity, and micro-nutrient deficiency. These are a result of inadequate access to healthy foods, increased use of highly processed foods, and low dietary diversity, besides factors related to sanitation. Changes in the practice of agriculture has resulted in a reduction in agrobiodiversity. The challenges to accessing food during shocks such as the
COVID-19
pandemic and conflicts in various parts of the world demonstrated the importance of local food security and reminded people of the importance of local food sources, including uncultivated or wild foods.

) in 2018 to mitigate catastrophic out-of-pocket health expenditure. This government-sponsored health insurance scheme is implemented through six digital portals, including a grievance redressal system, with the involvement of multiple stakeholders. The grievance redressal mechanisms in
PMJAY
are aimed at ensuring access to information, contribute to the responsiveness of the scheme and safeguard it against any fraudulent practices.
As a pioneering effort, this research explores the role and experiences of grievance redressal systems by exploring the following research questions: 1) What are the processes of collecting and responding to grievances in
PMJAY
? 2) How is the awareness about the Grievance Redressal System among the beneficiaries?, and 3) What is the experience of beneficiaries of interaction with the Grievance Redressal System of
PMJAY
?
A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted from January 2022 to August 2023 in Gujarat, using a mixed-method approach to data collection from various primary and secondary sources. The findings from the study show that multiple formal and informal channels are active with varying accessibility among the beneficiaries. A significant proportion of beneficiaries were unaware of their entitlements and grievance redressal mechanisms. Awareness was low regarding internet-based formal channels and communication through letters or emails.
The findings underscore the necessity for enhanced outreach efforts, using detailed information dissemination via print and outdoor media. Building trust in the grievance redressal system is essential to increase its use and demand among the beneficiaries. Insights from this study will be useful to strengthen the grievance redressal system of the
PMJAY
scheme or similar government schemes.

Towards a New Development Equilibrium among the Forest Dependent Adivasis of Central India — A Case for
Agrarian Adaptive Skilling

Abstract
In a homogenised imagination of human aspirations, development interventions replicate popular models, including intensive farming in Adivasi landscapes. In the process, they try to sedentarise and individualise Adivasi communities living in the forest peripheries. Even as modernisation remains an elusive target in most of the tribal belts, ethnic socio-ecological institutions become redundant, leaving the community deskilled — ecologically, socially, and economically. Adivasi’s concerns about this conventional development process entailing detribalisation are seldom deliberated in literature and among the community.

Authors
More
Abstract
Yellow foot Clam (Paphia malabarica) fishery of the Ashtamudi lake, one of the deepest lakes in Kerala supports the livelihoods of thousands of clam-collectors in the region. These clams are highly demanded in the international market and it enables the clam-collectors to generate their income through export began in late 80s. An increased export market demand exerted a lot of pressure on the resource which ultimately led to the depletion of clam resources. As a response to this unexpected decline in resource size and lost income, the clam collector community in Ashtamudi came forward to address the issue by forming a collective of clam-collectors at the village level. As a management strategy, they voluntarily abstained from fishing during the breeding season and demanded management of resource through a participatory mode of governance. After years of experience in the management of resource through voluntary measures, Ashtamudi clam resource entered a new régime of resource management. It got certified as
​
“
sustainable” resource by the world’s largest marine wild-catch certification program, the Marine Stewardship Council (
MSC
) which promotes the governance of marine fisheries resources through market incentives. This study is an attempt to understand these varied and unique governance régime experiences of clam resource from participatory to market-based systems and the implications of these governance regimes in the property rights, livelihoods and social development of clam-collectors of Ashtamudi.

Abstract
This paper examines Manipur’s census statistics for the period between 1991 and 2011. It argues that conventional demographic factors cannot explain the abnormal population growth rates reported in parts of Manipur and that the abnormalities in the headcount might instead be explained by the manipulation of census data driven by political and economic considerations. Manipur’s experience is used to draw attention to systemic problems related to the inadequacy of metadata supplied by the Census of India, the lack of guidelines for the correction of census data, the impact of political interference on data quality and the cascading effect of errors in fundamental statistics such as headcount on other government statistics.

The ordinary city and the extraordinary city : the challenges of planning for the everyday
in
Azim Premji University
Published
2020
Authors
More
Abstract
Recent work on informal urbanism argues that
​
‘
informality’ is a strong force in determining and shaping how cities in the global south grow, and hence needs to be a part of emergent urban theory. This paper uses this argument as a starting point, drawing upon the work of scholars who suggest that urban informality may have an organizing logic, a system of norms that emerge from the economic conditions and the social needs of people. Specifically, this paper examines informality in the urban space as an outcome of spatial and economic changes in a market precinct in Bangalore. It finds that activities in the street are temporal in nature. In this paper, the ordinary city encapsulates how people use urban spaces on an everyday basis and the extraordinary city reflects how urban spaces are transformed during a periodic, religious and cultural festival. The paper makes two key contributions, one, to show through an in-depth spatial ethnographic study how the
​
‘
ordinary – extraordinary’ might help us understand informal urbanism and two, to propose that it may be useful to have intermediate levels of planning that incorporate the conditions of the
​
‘
ordinary’ city as well as the
​
‘
extraordinary’ city, thereby contributing to both theory and practice.

Political and programmatic decentralization in India’s health sector : insights from Karnataka
in
Azim Premji University
Published
2019
Authors
More
Abstract
While India has made progress in achieving important health sector goals, there is still a long way to go. The Government of India has adopted decentralization or devolution with the objective of promoting greater equity and supporting people-centred, responsive health systems. We report on a study that problematizes the idea of strengthening health sector governance through decentralization and that explores the intersection of the political goal of enhanced local-level autonomy and the programmatic goal of more responsive health service delivery. The study examines the extent to which both political and programmatic decentralization are functional at the village level; looks at the design and objectives of decentralization at the village level; and considers whether sustained and supportive capacity building can create the necessary conditions for more genuine de facto decentralization and empowerment of village-level functionaries. Our methodology included semi-structured interviews with village-level functionaries in two districts of Karnataka, based on which we designed an Action Research to strengthen coordination and synergy between the functionaries responsible for political and programmatic decentralization. We found that both political and programmatic decentralization at the village level are at risk due to a lack of convergence between the political and programmatic arms of the government. This is substantially due to problems inherent in the design of the decentralization mechanism at the district level and below. Sustained capacity building can contribute to the more effective application of decentralization mechanisms, but systemic issues regarding the decentralization mechanisms need to be addressed alongside. We were also able to identify some spaces where coordination between village-level functionaries is possible, and the steps that need to be taken to build on this potential.

The Limitations of India’s Census Legislation
in
Azim Premji University
Published
2019
Authors
More
Abstract
Most discussions on the quality of government data overlook the legal framework within which data are collected. This paper examines India’s Census Act, 1948, which provides the legal-administrative framework for conducting human population census. The Act stipulates punishment for interfering with the process of enumeration, but the punitive provisions are rarely used and have not been invoked to deal with cases of mass manipulation of the census. Major instances of manipulation were, in fact, reported in 1951 and 2001 after the government introduced additional punitive measures in 1948 and 1994, respectively. This paper compares the Census Act, 1948 with other Indian laws related to the collection of statistics as well as census laws of other common law countries and identifies the structural flaws of the Indian law vis-à-vis manipulation. It uses simple games to explain why the punitive provisions of the Census Act, 1948 are redundant in the event of mass manipulation and suggests that the problem can be addressed without recourse to law. The insights drawn from the games are examined in light of the experience of Nagaland, a state of India where census statistics were manipulated on a large scale in 2001.

The persistent nucleus: atoms, power and energy policy discourse in the anthropocene
in
Azim Premji University
Published
2018
Authors
More
Abstract
Despite economic debacles, recurring
​
“
accidents”, reactor core meltdowns in Chernobyl and Fukushima and the cautious academic reflection it has engendered, civilian nuclear power continues to enjoy legitimacy in energy policy discourse. This may not be the case in all countries. But it is so in a number of influential states, such as, prominently, all the permanent members of the
UN
Security Council. Why does nuclear power persist in these and other key countries, such as India or Iran and Japan? How is it that economic costs, technology risks and weapons proliferation concerns point in one direction while energy policy and technology choice moves in the other? We suggest that for an important set of select countries this divergence can be ascribed to a
​
“
discourse of power” that is pegged to domestic concerns and, more importantly, to international relations. This discursive process constructs energy and material abundance as the cornerstone of social stability, political power and ultimately national sovereignty and geopolitical influence. The atom’s energy remains prominent in such imaginaries of abundance, more so in contexts of fossil energy insecurity and climate change. The questioning then of nuclear power by environmental and social concerns has to also question this discourse of power. The latter’s sanguinity vis-a-vis abundant energy needs to be problematised. This is not the case today in international relations. Practitioners focus on the consequences of environmental deterioration. The problem of climate refugees, for example. This paper argues that realist frames of power and self-interest in international relations be acknowledged explicitly as drivers of the discourse of power and in turn the socio-ecological consequences that ensue from this pursuit of cheap and abundant energy. To challenge nuclear power ultimately is to also challenge this medieval yet dominant norm of power play that pervades large swathes of international relations.

A call for development of a growth standard to measure malnutrition of school-age children
in
Azim Premji University
Published
2018
Authors
More
Abstract
There is no globally established standard for measuring malnutrition among children aged 5 – 18 years. Growth references are used as a standard but there are many limitations to using such references to assess nutritional status of Indian children. As per the World Health Organization, standards and references both serve as a basis for comparison, but each enables a different interpretation. A standard defines how children should grow; and deviations from the pattern it prescribes are evidence of abnormal growth. A reference, on the other hand, does not provide a basis for such value judgments, although in practice, references often are mistakenly used as standards. This paper has conducted a methodological review of prevalence of malnutrition from openly accessible literature pertaining to assessment of nutritional status of school-going children in India from the year 2000 to 2016. The methodological review reveals that a combination of different national and international references have been used in assessing nutritional status of Indian children. International references includes
NCHS
1977,
CDC
2000,
WHO
2007,
IOTF
2012 extended Body Mass Index (
BMI
) cut- offs, Gomez classification, Waterlow’s classification and national references such as — Agarwal standards,
ICMR
reference values,
IAP
reference and
BMI
cut-off for overweight
&
obesity of Indian children. A new national growth reference has been recently developed by Marwaha and others (2011) for
BMI
, but no assessment of nutritional status using this reference was found. Each of these methods was then applied to a database containing height, weight, age and sex of 5340 school-going children. Though there are three nutritional indicators for school-age children, majority of the study conducted used only
BMI
chart to assess nutritional status. Therefore BMI-for-age is considered for the analysis to i) understand the methodological application of the above growth references ii) compare the differences in nutritional status and iii) recommend an appropriate growth reference (from those available) to assess the nutritional status of Indian school-age children. The literature review also reveals that malnutrition among school-age children is prevalent in India. There is no national level data available to support this judgement across regions, gender and caste. Given a likely high prevalence of malnutrition, this paper calls for the development of a growth standard to measure malnutrition among school-age children in India. Though this paper is focused on malnutrition, it simultaneously provides similar importance to over growth. A growth Standard therefore fills up such gaps in measuring double burden of malnutrition i.e. under-nutrition and over-nutrition.

Lakes of Bengaluru : the once living, but now endangered peri-urban commons
in
Azim Premji University
Published
2018
Authors
More
Abstract
Cities of the Global South are expanding both spatially and demographically. While urbanization may contribute to economic growth and employment generation, the impacts of urbanization on sustainability of cities is manifold. One area that is witnessing rapid land use change as a result of urbanization is the peri-urban interface of cities in India. This is especially true in the case of natural spaces that are also common pool resources. In this working paper, we examine the transformation of lakes in the peri-urban interface of Bengaluru city in the south Indian state of Karnataka. Based on
GPS
observations and interviews, we found that lakes in our study area varied in status and use: ranging from those in a good condition that served multiple uses to those converted to other forms of land use, resulting in loss of all services. We also accessed archival information to underscore the role that one of the lakes in the study area played in serving as a source of water during a time of scarcity. Using the example of lakes in Bengaluru, this paper presents the threats faced by commons in the peri-urban interface of rapidly expanding cities in the Global South. These threats are not restricted to changes to land use alone, but also concern their transformation into recreational sites at the cost of users who depend on them for livelihood and subsistence. We argue for management of the lakes in the peri-urban interface not only as ecosystems that supports ecological and economic uses, but as commons that are a reflection of the diversity and heterogeneity that cities such as Bengaluru represent.

NSSO
surveys along India’s periphery : data quality and its implications
in
Azim Premji University
Published
2017
Authors
More
Abstract
Sample surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (
NSSO
) are the most widely used sources of household level information about consumption, employment, and other socio-economic indicators in India. The representativeness of samples, the wide range of topics surveyed, and the availability of a long-time series are some of the reasons for the appeal of
NSSO
data for research and policy. This paper assesses the quality of the
NSSO
data for Nagaland and Jammu and Kashmir, which lie in India’s politically restive ethno-geographical periphery. It argues that the
NSSO
data for these states during 1973 – 2014 lack representativeness and inter-temporal comparability due to faulty sampling frames, frame and sample non-coverage, and biased samples. It quantifies the impact of data quality on statistics of interest to policy-makers. The paper shows that the estimates of monthly per capita consumption expenditure (
MPCE
) are sensitive to non-coverage and argues that the incidence of poverty is underestimated because
NSSO
surveys failed to capture the complete distribution of consumption expenditure due to non-coverage. In Nagaland, the degree of non-coverage was so high that in most years between 1993 – 94 and 2011-12 the state’s poverty headcount ratio was the lowest in the country despite the possible overestimation of its poverty line. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the use of non-representative survey data. Put together, the unreliability of government statistics in Jammu and Kashmir and Nagaland highlights systemic problems that have wider implications for our understanding of the relationship between state, statistics, and policy-making.

Exploring hybrid spaces through an informal science learning programme
in
Azim Premji University
Published
2017
Authors
More
Abstract
This paper explores the construction of hybrid spaces through the observation of middle school children engaged in short science projects in an informal science learning programme. Hybrid spaces are not just physical structures, but refer to contexts, relationships and knowledges developed by children as their social worlds and identities merge with the normative expectations of school science. Hybrid spaces have been characterised in three different ways: as a convergent space between academic and traditionally marginalized knowledges and discourses; as a navigational space, or a way of crossing and succeeding in different discourse communities; and as a space of cultural, social and epistemological change where competing knowledges and discourses challenge and reshape both academic and everyday knowledges. (Moje et al., 2004; Barton et al., 2008). This paper characterises such hybrid paces by analysing activities of children working on short projects in the broad area of:
​
‘
Trees, plants and insects’, during a summer camp held at the Azim Premji University. Children seemed to primarily use the
​
‘
third space’ to navigate between different funds of knowledge and succeed in science. They developed science artefacts such as scrapbooks and a children’s magazine, and negotiated new roles for participating and expressing their developing science identities. They also brought in local knowledge and activities from their home contexts such as gardening, cooking and socialisation with members of their own and wider community. Informal settings help in the negotiation, construction and development of these hybrid spaces, and is particularly meaningful for children who otherwise see science as being alien and outside their everyday lives. Children brought different funds of knowledge into their participation and discussions from both their formal and informal experiences linked to science. Children decided their own trajectory of learning experiences in consultation with the facilitator. This paper also describes various possibilities in informal settings and learning experiences within and outside formal school settings, which help children explore and engage more deeply with their developing interests in science.

Exploitative Informal Labour Process in India: a conceptualisation
in
Azim Premji University
Published
2017
Authors
More
Abstract
This working paper will focus on conceptualising why informal labour continues to persist in the Indian economy. More specifically, it will try to theorise why, despite generating growth, informal labour has been locked in unequal and exploitative terms of contracts. Crucially, it will try to understand why informal labour processes do not evolve mechanisms for providing security and support to labour in the form of benefits and rights. In this paper, I will focus specifically on highly exploitative and unequal informal labour processes. I categorise under this category those labour processes that do not provide a mechanism to reproduce labour power. These processes are predicated on maximising the appropriation of surplus from labour, without providing any provision to support the workers in ill health, facing work related accidents and injuries, or due to retrenchment. While informal labour is defined as labour without legal rights or contracts, I specifically focus on those processes where there do not exist any norms or mechanisms of providing security to labour within the production process. Hence, I refer to these processes as highly exploitative and unequal labour processes. This paper will be structured in the following manner. Firstly, it will introduce the concept of labour process and argue that highly exploitative informal labour processes in India broadly fall into two distinct labour processes namely: informal coercive accumulation process and petty commodity production. It will then derive concepts from the Paris Regulation School to modify the labour process framework. It will then describe concrete case studies conducted by other researchers, to demonstrate that this framework can be utilised to make sense of field work based research on the informal sector. Lastly, I will assess the questions posed in this paper based on the derived framework and will argue that informality is connected to the nature of capitalist development in India.

Role of voluntary teacher forums (VTFs) in continuous teacher professional development in India: experiences from Rajasthan, Karnataka and Puducherry
in
Azim Premji University
Published
2017
Authors
More
Abstract
The quality of education depends largely upon the teacher. Hence building teacher capacity through continuous professional development of teachers is critical to the quality of education. Systems and programs for continuous professional development for school teachers in the formal educational system in India are inadequate and often ill-conceived. Apart from other lacunae, they often do not recognize the professional identity and agency of the teacher. Voluntary Teacher Forums (VTFs) that are facilitated by Azim Premji Foundation in different locations of India, as part of an integrated and multimodal approach to continuous professional development, try to address this central issue. This study shows that VTFs are evolving as very useful platforms for collaboration and peer learning amongst teachers in various locations. It shows that given an environment that allows for easy access to meaningful opportunities, teachers will commit their time, talents and resources to their own professional development. The study further recognizes however, that the real issue is to understand how such forums can be made to happen in different locations in a context as complex as the Indian public education system. While this study highlights certain crucial dimensions of the VTFs – including what happens within these forums and the efforts that go behind it – these continue to be subjects for our future research works.

Curbing crony capitalism in India
in
Azim Premji University
Published
2017
Authors

Abstract
Economic reforms sought to replace the Indian statedominant economy with a liberal, competitive market economy. However, a plethora of recent scams indicate that collusive rentsharing arrangements between business and policy makers are prevalent. A nexus has developed, linking politicians and business, as well as the bureaucracy. These trends signal a breakdown of competitive markets and the accumulation of wealth via corruption. This paper explains crony capitalism within a framework of interaction between four stakeholder groups whose motives and behaviour have altered in the recent context. These are political executives, political parties, business entities and the bureaucracy. Using the coal mine block allocation controversy as a case study, we examine the modus operandi of crony capitalism as a capture of the policy process. We examine the limitations of the present corrective political and legal processes.
The paper concludes with a set of recommendations for curbing crony capitalism via reform of :

Notes on Nagaland’s area
in
Azim Premji University
Published
2017
Authors
More
Abstract
Empirical research in economics and, to a lesser extent, in other social sciences is largely dependent upon government statistics. It is generally assumed that governments are committed to collecting and disseminating correct statistics. As a result, the mutually constitutive relationship between politics, economy, and statistics, and the possibility of systematic manipulation of statistics-driven by the structural features of this relationship, has received insufficient attention within economics. This paper examines the implications of the absence of shared preferences over the quality of statistics within a government. It explores the multiplicity of conflicting maps of the State of Nagaland issued by different tiers and wings of the government to underscore the lack of attention paid to a statistic as crucial as area. The paper situates the cartographic-statistical confusion in its political and economic contexts, and suggests that political-geographic arguments are being used to advance political-economic interests along contested borders. It argues that the confusion is not amenable to a technical resolution as it is linked to the dispute over Nagaland’s place within the Union of India and the border disputes between Nagaland and its neighbouring states.

An intervention into the debates on
​
‘
work-in-education’ and skill development in India

Azim Premji University
Published
2016
Authors
More
Abstract
The paper analyses the debates surrounding
​
‘
work’ as part, or as an outcome, of school education in India and argues that these have not reckoned adequately the socioeconomic reality of the corresponding times. The outcome of education depends on ideas and resources shaping its provisioning, and the use by the people. Colonial rulers provided a liberal schooling which did not aim at
​
‘
schooling for all’ or imparting skills as part of schooling. Such an education was attractive to those children who were not working in agriculture or artisanal occupations for their livelihood or who belonged to a
​
‘
rentier’ class. The lower opportunity cost of time for these children and the probability of getting a job in the colonial administration enabled this small section of society to opt for such a liberal schooling. It is in this context that Gandhi wanted to use work (or agricultural and artisanal skills) as a pedagogical tool for education. However, the majority of children who were bound to do such work then did not view formal schooling, which aimed at imparting these
​
‘
skills’, attractive.

Abstract
Malnutrition levels in India remain a major public health challenge. According to the fourth round of the District Level Household Survey (
DLHS
‑4, 2012 – 13), almost 30 percent of all children under the age of 5 are underweight in most states. This is a serious cause for concern for several reasons: low weight-for-age has been associated with a range of disadvantages, including a higher risk of dying due to several disease conditions among young children; changes in the autonomic nervous system; higher risk of hypertension and insulinresistance in adulthood; adverse impacts on brain development, cognitive ability and school achievement; and behavioural problems such as anxiety and hostility later in life.

Abstract
Urban spaces emerging as nodes and drivers of global capital are recognized as centres of economic growth; while the rest of the geography is consigned to the residual category commonly referred to as
​
‘
rural’. Diversity and increasing numbers of urban centres do not seem to alter this dichotomous perception of urban-rural landscapes and this dichotomy extends to policies and institutions. Nevertheless, the diversity in expansion and extraction pattern of the urban core is reflected in the way it transforms and interacts with its peripheries, fostering types of interfaces that depict urban and rural characteristics and processes to various extents.

Education for social change
Education for social change
We are a space for social change.
We believe that education can and should contribute to human development and well-being. Over the years, we have nurtured a community of individuals motivated by the values enshrined in the Indian constitution: a commitment to social justice, equity, humane values and sustainability.
We believe that higher education can create critical and reflective practitioners with an understanding of the social impact of education, the law and development.
Our
programmes
are designed to prepare reflective and critical practitioners who can bring their educational experience at the University to practice on the ground — with competence, integrity, and most of all, social commitment.
A caring community
We believe that social change begins with care.
We care for the well-being of each individual in our community. We hope that learning can be a dynamic and creative process that will help all individuals discover their potential.
Our diverse community of students are from all over India with a wealth of experiences. They come from a vast diversity in socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. We understand that generations of social inequality in India makes the experience of the classroom unique for each student.
We support our student community through the various challenges they face in their academic journeys, inside and outside the classroom.
In the classroom
We strive to create an inclusive environment for learning. We provide assistance and different forms of support in the classroom to ensure that disadvantages of social background do not hinder a creative and fulfilling academic experience.
Our community of faculty and mentors are committed to a caring classroom experience. We provide academic support for foundational capacities in language, reasoning and quantitative analysis through the course of different academic programmes. We offer remedial support whenever necessary for students to get through their coursework.
We help each of our students understand their hopes and nurture their dreams.
Beyond the classroom
University is a time for the exploration of oneself and the world. We support our students through the challenges they face not only in the classroom but in the peer group and in their personal lives.
We ensure a supportive and collegial environment and access to help for those in need and understand that special circumstances may arise any time.
We provide
counselling services
on and off campus, along with peer-support groups run by students on campus. Our mentorship programme takes care of each individual through the course of their study.
Financial assistance
We believe that nobody should drop out because of financial problems. We provide extensive financial aid to help students fund their study.
Careers
We ensure that our graduates make successful choices in the jobs they go on to do. Our
Placement Cell
ensures that our graduates are equipped with the skills needed to make effective decisions in a competitive environment of jobs. We assist our students in finding employment opportunities well suited to their needs.

Programme Structure
The programme is designed to inculcate an interdisciplinary orientation drawing from development literature and management sciences. It focusses on building the analytical, domain-related and managerial competencies to strengthen social sector organisations.
The one-year programme will be divided into four terms, three of which will be classroom-based, and one will be field-based. These terms are organised to enable progressive learning for the participants. Field-based learning will be interspersed between the classroom terms.

This experiential learning is facilitated through two components:
A two-week long field immersion
An eight-week long internship in a social sector organisation
Classroom Practices
The classroom practices in our programme are designed to ensure an inclusive and immersive learning experience, blending theory with hands-on practice. The programme uses a diverse mix of lectures, group discussions, peer learning, audio-visual materials, and case studies to make complex concepts accessible to students from a wide range of academic and socio-economic backgrounds and work experience.
Group work is a key aspect of the programme, emphasising the importance of collective learning and collaboration. Field experience is integrated into the programme structure, offering students opportunities for immersive, real-world experiences, thus helping students apply classroom learning to address fundamental organisational issues in social sector organisations.
Many courses feature guest lectures from sector experts and practitioners who bring contemporary, real-world insights into the classroom. Our faculty members are highly accessible, offering additional support during office hours.
Career Opportunities
The programme will prepare students to be future leaders of social sector organisations, responsible to all stakeholders in the society. Some opportunities for transformative career shifts and possible career trajectories include:
Leading the implementation of large programmes in social sector organisations
Facilitating organisational growth through people management and fundraising
Playing a leadership role in the rapid growth environment of social enterprises, large cooperatives and farmer producer companies
Managing programme grants at donor foundations, philanthropies and
CSR

CSR
foundations, development consultancies, and impact-driven enterprises.
A dedicated
Placement Cell
provides comprehensive support, training, and career guidance, helping students navigate their professional journeys with confidence. Additionally, the

Distinguished Indian Economists
Swaying Minds and Shaping the Modern Indian Economy
This project explores the contributions of modern Indian economists, whose ideas and analyses have not only shaped India’s economic trajectory but also generated a deeper understanding of development and growth in the country. It aims to provide a comprehensive platform for understanding the intellectual legacy of Indian economists within the broader context of economic theory and the unique challenges of modern India. In doing so, we hope it helps fill in two gaps. First, it addresses the lack of information on Indian economics and economists online on the one hand. And second, it is a contribution to the quest for a more pluralistic economics.
The economists featured in this site are no longer with us but their ideas have been central for understanding economic processes and in particular, taking head on the specific questions that were faced by the newly independent nation. They come from all regions of the country and are from various political and methodological persuasions. But they all had something in common:  to paraphrase the economist Robert Heilbroner: they all swayed people’s minds.
We have been fortunate to have had several well-known academics and economists who were willing to write extensively and outline the lives and pioneering contributions of these thinkers. They are mentioned in the articles, and this project would not have been possible without their efforts.
This is meant to be a living resource and while here we begin with around two dozen economists, we hope to update and expand the resources here over time. We hope not only to feature many more economists, but also to expand to different aspects of Indian economic history (specific debates, institutions and committees and so on).
If you are a student, researcher, or simply curious about the intersection of economics and history, this project invites you to explore the rich intellectual heritage of modern Indian economists and their enduring relevance in addressing the challenges of today and tomorrow. It is also a labour of love and we expect that despite our best efforts, there may be some infelicities or inaccuracies. Please do write to us if you find any and we will be happy to correct them. Should you feel there is a glaring omission, or better still, wish to contribute a piece, please do contact us as well.

Is effective leadership of development organisations only about the ability to implement multiple programmes and managing teams? Or, are organisational leaders expected to have a broader understanding of development theories, India’s overall development journey, frameworks of development action, and organisational cultures and leadership approaches?
Should leadership of development organisations be based on the same organisational principles which apply in the corporate world? Or, does the development ecosystem and organisational context require us to rethink some of these principles?
Our Postgraduate Diploma programme emerges from and responds to such questions to enable mid-career and senior-level professionals to prepare for leadership roles in their organisations. We aim to advance participants’ understanding of development leadership beyond programmatic considerations, by helping them anchor their rich experiences and within a broader understanding of civil society and its trajectories.

Applied Game Theory
How did cooperation evolve? Why do stereotypes persist? Why are degrees considered so important? Why do political parties hold rallies
Facilitator
Anand Shrivastava
Most choices we make, like choosing to take a cab instead of a bus, or choosing to vote for a political party, or choosing to forward a social media post, affects other people’s choices and their choices, in turn, ours. These complex interactions shape many of the social and economic outcomes that we see around us. Game theory gives you tools to understand these interactions and gain some insight into many interesting and important questions about competition, elections and social norms amongst others.

Internship
The Master’s Internship carries 6 credits and entails an eight-week engagement, typically with a civil society organisation or government official, to gain practical experience of work in the development sector. In the Internship track, students will be able to put their theoretical and analytical knowledge into practice. Students opting for Master’s Internship track will need to do an additional elective worth 3 credits in their fourth semester. This will ensure that they graduate in the programme with a minimum requirement of 80 credits.
Field Practice
3 credits
In the first Winter Break, students work in a rural area with ground organisations and are exposed to the lived realities of rural India.This three-week intensive engagement is mandatory for all students, and helps cultivate a deeper understanding of socio-economic challenges that are faced by local communities. It also helps students think about theoretical concepts in real world contexts, and apply qualitative research skills learnt in the first semester.

Introduction to Quantitative Methods in Economics
Do we need to study maths to learn economics?
Facilitators
Anand Shrivastava
Zico Dasgupta
In this course, we explore topics in linear algebra and calculus to create a basic understanding of Mathematics as a tool for studying economics. This is a foundational course covering concepts from real numbers, polynomial functions, logarithm and exponentials, set theory, matrices, differential calculus, and basic optimisation.
The idea is to make you an expert as well as comfortable with basic mathematics (which is often used in economics) so that you do not face any difficulties later in learning, analysing, and understanding different concepts in microeconomics, macroeconomics, development, and econometrics.

Economics is an attempt to understand everyday lives, a study of how people interact with each other and the natural environment to produce and reproduce their livelihoods. It is about the various sorts of social dealings that create, coordinate and maintain the structures of our lives: markets, states or social norms. Some of its questions attempt to understand how human beings cooperate and work together, why productive activity takes different forms, and why labour, which we all do in different ways, are treated with different values.

Occupational Minor
Students must be prepared for the world of work at the end of the programme should they choose to enter it. We aim to provide the required skills and competencies for this through a Minor featuring courses in an
Occupational or Interdisciplinary theme.
These sets of courses are aimed to provide both conceptual understanding and skills and tools that will allow students to contribute through work and further study.
Students can opt for a Minor in any one of the indicative areas listed below.
The selection of these indicative areas is based on the availability of courses and our evaluation of the student’s interests and academic needs. For each cohort, a final list of available courses will be announced at the end of their second semester.
Music Education
The undergraduate Occupational Track programme in Music Education is designed in collaboration with SaPa, the Subramaniam Academy of Performing Arts. SaPa is on a mission to make quality music education accessible to all. A large part of this involves creating enough music teachers to build the ecosystem for music education, and creating certifications and knowledge sets to make music teachers employable, both in schools and at music institutions.The Music Education OT aligns with this objective and aims to offer students an understanding of music itself, and how music may be taught in different environments. This will help students be employable,…

There is a lot of scope for facilitating the work of these organizations through the use of digital technology. While accomplishing social change is a slow process requiring long-term engagement, digital technology can assist these organizations in making their operations more effective and by permitting better utilization of scarce resources.

Sports and Fitness
We believe that a regimen of physical activity can have a powerful effect on an individual’s physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Sport can be used as an effective tool to help an individual learn crucial life skills and also to build an empathetic, equitable community. In these set of courses, we want you to have a powerful experience of sport not just as a physical activity but as a way to build yourself and your social surroundings. We also want to teach you ways in which you can create these transformational experiences for others.

Flexible Courses
Students can craft their own educational experience by selecting courses in the following ways:
Students will have the option to take additional courses in their Disciplinary Major.
Interdisciplinary Minor that will enable them for their further higher studies or career pathways.
These courses could also be selected to enhance and broaden their
Language skills and Quantitative reasoning capacities/​​programming skills.
Understanding of themes outside their Major subject.
Classroom Practices
Over the course of the programme, students will be exposed to a range of pedagogical practices including lectures, seminars, group-based learning, and active learning strategies.
We are committed to providing an environment where students and faculty are engaged in active learning, which involves the practical application of knowledge and skills through real-world experiences and problem-solving. There are a number of ways we promote active learning and direct application of economics for students outside of the classroom from fieldwork, internships, and opportunities for research.
We recognise the diversity of backgrounds and capabilities that students come with and have designed the programme to respond to their individual needs including those with disabilities and neurodiversity.

International Conference on the History of Economic Thought 2023
The conference hosted close to 50 paper presentations over two days, covering a wide range of themes and thinkers: African to Indian economic thought, Ambedkar to Sraffa, Keynesian to Feminist economics, Kautilya to Ibn Khaldun. The presenters also span various stages of career, with a large number of presentations by undergraduate and graduate students, who were able to receive feedback from senior and distinguished scholars in the field. The conference was preceded by a one-day workshop oriented at teachers of History of Economic Thought.
The two keynote lectures were delivered by leading
HET
scholars Maria Bach and Francois Allison, both affiliated with the Centre Walras Pareto, University of Lausanne, Switzerland. Explore more details

Demystifying Economics 2023
The second edition of the Demystifying Economics has been jointly organised by Azim Premji University, Bahujan Economists and School for Democracy.
The idea of this workshop is not to lecture participants on Economics, but to the extent possible, democratise the language and the discipline of Economics itself. This is because the participants of this workshop, who are members of various civil society organisations across India, are already best positioned to understand the complex nature of the social, political and economic reality on the ground, but owing to a variety of factors, most notably being bereft of technical vocabulary, they get relegated to being spectators in the larger gambit. Keeping this in mind, we have designed multiple sessions in this workshop, shedding light on the concepts of Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Political Economy and Statistics as relevant to the contexts of our participants.

Advanced Graduate Workshop 2023
In 2006, Professors Joseph Stiglitz and Akbar Noman started a small interdisciplinary workshop titled
​
‘
Advanced Graduate Workshop (
AGW
) on Poverty, Development and Globalisation’. Ever since, the workshop has mentored and hosted scholars from all across the world. For the past 10 years,
AGW
has been organised by Azim Premji University in collaboration with the Institute for New Economic Thinking. The Economics group at Azim Premji University remains closely associated with this workshop in various scopes and roles.
The goal of the workshop is to bring together graduate students studying economic development at a sufficiently advanced stage of their dissertation to be able to discuss and receive feedback on their research. The success of
AGW
lies in creating a supportive and friendly environment which makes students comfortable to discuss and provide feedback on each other’s work. Explore more details

Srishti Yadav
Zico Dasgupta
Programme
BA in Economics
This course introduces students to basic macroeconomic concepts and theories but differently than the conventional courses. This is accomplished by adopting a historically and socio-politically informed standpoint in the teaching material, pedagogy and assessments. The course exposes students to macroeconomic themes like national income accounting, determination of output and employment, fiscal and monetary policies. It provides students with a series of capstones that allow for them to engage with real world issues like inequality, unemployment and ecological challenges. Students learn to interpret macroeconomic data in the Indian context.

Biography
Srishti holds a PhD in Economics from The New School, New York, and an
MA
in Economics from Jawaharlal Nehru University (
JNU
), New Delhi. Growing up in Haryana, she has always been interested in the role of agriculture in India’s economy.
The field of Political Economy of Development allows her to frame this interest theoretically, and ask critical questions— despite rapid growth, why is the Indian economy predominantly agricultural? What is the nature of production relations within agriculture? In different parts of the country, how do agricultural and non-agricultural economies interact? What is the role of caste and gender in shaping these interactions? These questions, which require field-based research alongside the analysis of secondary data, motivated her doctoral research.
Her ongoing work spills over from the political economy of production relations in agriculture to the political economy of non-agricultural informality. She hopes to conduct fieldwork for this project soon.
Before joining the University, she taught Political Economy and Microeconomics at University of Manitoba, Canada. She has also taught courses in Political Economy of Development and Macroeconomics at Eugene Lang College, The New School, and St. Francis College, Brooklyn.
Apart from research and teaching, she enjoys reading murder mysteries, gardening, and listening to music.
She is a recipient of the following awards:
Edith Henry Johnson Memorial Award in Economics, Civil Affairs and Education, awarded by the New School for Social Research for distinction in doctoral research in 2021
Union for Radical Political Economy Dissertation Fellowship ($5000) awarded in 2020

Income Distribution and Effective Demand in the Indian Economy
Azim Premji University,
August 2020
Read Online
Abstract
Does there exist a trade-off between labour’s income share and output growth rate? Or does a reduction in wage share in itself reduce the output growth rate? These questions have returned to the centre stage in the midst of India’s present crisis as the government sought the dilution and suspension of labour laws as a counter-cyclical policy instrument. In the absence of any other stimulus or countervailing factors, the impact of such a policy would hinge on the relationship between income distribution and effective demand. This paper attempts to lay bare this relationship for the Indian economy through an empirical analysis of India’s macro data and a theoretical model on the basis of regression results.

A Short Note on Debt-Neutral Fiscal Policy
Azim Premji University,
January 2021
Read Online
Abstract
One of the central concerns against increasing expenditures in the recent period has been the possibility of an adverse impact on debt-GDP ratio. Once stability of debt-ratio is regarded as a policy-objective, the aggregate expenditure that is consistent with the stability condition gets determined by the given level of output growth rate and revenue receipts. Instead of perceiving expenditures to be determined by the debt-stability condition, this short note attempts to lay bare the conditions under which the debt-stability condition is restored despite increasing the growth rate of non-capital primary expenditure to a targeted level. The targeted level can be perceived as one which fully compensates the income loss of labour during the pandemic. In contrast to conventional wisdom, the possibility of increasing non-capital expenditures is explored not by reducing capital expenditures, but rather by increasing the latter. Using the multiplier value of capital expenditures estimated by the
RBI
, it is argued that the debt-ratio would remain unchanged despite increasing the growth rate of non-capital primary expenditure if the capital expenditures growth rate is allowed to increase in a specific proportion.

Programme
MA in Economics
Offered At
Campus
Bengaluru
Specialisation
Economy and the market
The course surveys macroeconomic theory and its evolution through the use of rigorous mathematical and logical models. Macroeconomics primarily deals with the determinations and relations of five variables, namely: (i) Gross Domestic/​National Product, (ii) Employment/​unemployment, (iii) Price Level/Inflation-Deflation, (iv) Balance of Payments and the exchange rate and (v), Growth. The focus of this course is mainly on short run macroeconomics. The course is primarily designed to give an exposure to the students of the developments in macroeconomic theory during the 20
th
century since Keynes’s important contribution to economics in 1936, by developing the key ideas of aggregate demand and liquidity preference. It will also introduce students to the macroeconomics of developing economies, sometimes called
​
‘
structuralist macroeconomics’ as part of the course.

Biography
Following my MStat (Masters in Statistics) from Indian Statistical Institute, I went on to pursue my PhD in Economics from the University of California, Davis. As an applied economist, I seek to investigate how historical institutions, whether formal or informal, have persistent, long-run effect on inequality, human capital accumulation, growth, development, and diversity. For example, in one of the chapters of my doctoral research I use archived graduation records of students from elite universities to trace group-level social mobility in India for different caste and religious groups over the last 150 years. In fact, I find it fascinating to extract and analyse economic information from historical texts – whether these are pieces of ancient literature or boring records maintained by bureaucrats/​institutions. Therefore, fellow economists often classify me as an Economic Historian, however, my research spans several other fields such as Labour, Development and Political Economy as well.
I love to teach as much and have taught several courses in Economics to both undergraduate and graduate students including a unique course,
​
“
How to Teach Economics” to PhD students at University of California, Davis. At Azim Premji University, I am currently teaching two courses: Intermediate Microeconomics (
UG
) and Economics of Identity (
PG
).
I am also a regular contributor of op-ed articles at Al Jazeera. At different turns of life, I wanted to be a poet, a theatre practitioner, or a filmmaker, but failed so bad, that I decided to become an Economist instead. Nevertheless, poetry, films and theatre continue to be my breathing space till date.

Microeconomics
Do individuals calculate their actions to suit consequences? Are individual’s choices purely self-interested? How do individual behaviours affect social institutions? And how can policies take heed to these behaviours? Up to a certain point in history, microeconomic theory answered these questions with pre-determined assumptions. Microeconomic theory has since moved a long way, now including wide-ranging insights from different disciplines and ideas in order to understand how to model individual behaviour, social interaction and conflict, and understand how these change over time. In this course, you will look at the behaviour of individuals, households, firms and the interaction and organisation of markets and institutions. You will learn how economists evaluate social outcomes. You will learn newer insights from behavioural, experimental and evolutionary economics as well as from more established building blocks like game theory and contract theory.

Economics of Identity
How does a sense of self determine and affect economic outcomes?
Facilitator
Tamoghna Halder
Offered At
Campus
Bengaluru
Specialisation
Social identity
This course exposes students to different identity based socio-economic inequalities in India and abroad. The course begins with a discussion of empirical evidence on gender, caste and race-based inequalities, and introduces students to debates on how to measure such inequalities in different contexts. Subsequently, it offers explanations of why and how such inequalities emerge, persist, and evolve. In this part, students engage with different theoretical frameworks, to understand how different schools of thought may arrive at distinct explanations of these inequalities. Finally, the course exposes students to different solutions emerging from these different schools of thought on how to eradicate such inequalities. This involves a detailed discussion on the role of state/​policy makers, markets, and social movements. Throughout the course, students are required to engage with both theoretical concepts and empirical tools so that at the end of the course, they are able to assess identity-based inequalities from a variety of entry points as well as techniques.

The course will delve into some selected areas of microeconomic theory where there has been active research in recent years and give students the understanding and the tools to engage with these areas. The topics will include evolutionary game theory, network analysis and mechanism design. The course builds on the models that the students leant in the courses Microeconomics: Theory and applications 1 and 2 and gets the students to apply and extend them to more advanced situations, such as the application of game theory in a dynamic context using evolutionary logic for defining equilibria. Additionally, students are also introduced to concepts and tools that are not taught in a traditional microeconomics course, such as using graph theory to analyze networks of people or firms, which are very relevant in current microeconomic research. The course is ideal for students who want to continue to do economics research, either as part of a PhD or otherwise, after completing the master’s programme.

How Comparable are India’s Labour Market Surveys?
Azim Premji University,
January 2022
Read Online
Abstract
The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy’s (
CMIE
) Consumer Pyramid Household surveys have emerged as an important source of regular labour market data for India. Given the differences in methods in data collection between the
CMIE
and official employment sources, it becomes exceedingly important to establish some comparability between the government and the
CMIE
datasets. With the release of the official labour surveys, Periodic Labour Force Surveys for 2017 – 18, we now have an overlap between the official datasets and
CMIE
datasets. In this paper, we examine the extent of comparability of labour force estimates from these two datasets. We find that employment estimates for men are broadly comparable. However, for women, there is a consistent divergence with
CMIE
estimates of women’s workforce participation lower than that of
NSS-PLFS
. We explore the points of divergence in the measurement of women’s work and hypothesise some potential reasons for this difference. We find that irrespective of the reference period used in the
PLFS
estimation of employment statuses, there is no convergence with the
CMIE
employment estimate for women’s employment. Moreover, the mismatch in
CMIE-PLFS
estimates occurs across all types of women’s employment and irrespective of what reference period of employment (in official data) is used.

Cross State comparison of Excess Deaths During the Covid Pandemic in India: Some Measurement and Methodological Considerations
in
Azim Premji University
CSIE Working Paper Series
Published
2025
Authors

Abstract
This paper assesses excess mortality in India during the
COVID-19
pandemic, focusing on the year 2021 when the country experienced a substantial surge in deaths. Drawing on newly released official data from the Civil Registration System (
CRS
) and the Sample Registration System (
SRS
), and supplemented with estimates based on the National Family Health Survey (
NFHS
‑5), we construct a range of mortality estimates using multiple baseline comparisons. Excess deaths are calculated in absolute terms, per 1,000 population, and using age-standardised death rates to facilitate cross-state and international comparisons. Particular attention is paid to persistent challenges in India’s mortality data landscape, including regional disparities in death registration completeness, limitations in cause-of-death certification, and inconsistencies between administrative and survey-based sources. The analysis includes alternative projections that adjust for estimated registration completeness, underscoring the sensitivity of mortality estimates to underlying data assumptions. By applying standard demographic techniques such as age standardisation, we attempt to mitigate the effects of India’s heterogeneous age structure and registration coverage. The findings suggest a substantial mortality impact from the pandemic, exceeding officially reported figures, and raise broader questions about the capacity of statistical systems to support real-time health surveillance. We identify correlates in terms of state capacity.These results have implications for public health preparedness, intergovernmental coordination, and the long-term strengthening of civil registration and vital statistics systems in India.

Blue Food: A Perspective Aligned with Adoption of Sustainable Development Goals

Abstract
The increasing global demand for food, coupled with the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation, has shifted attention towards blue food systems. While these systems offer a potential solution to food security challenges, their sustainability is threatened by various factors, including overfishing, habitat destruction, and climate change. Recognising these challenges, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (
FAO
,
UN
) advocates for ensuring the sustainable contribution of aquatic food systems to global food security and nutrition, aligning with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDGs). It was hypothesised that adoption of UN-SDGs would increase the interest of researchers in sustainability of fisheries and aquaculture. Therefore, a bibliometric analysis of the relevant literature published between 2000 and 2023 was conducted to test this hypothesis. The analysis revealed a significant rise in publications addressing climate change and sustainability after the adoption of the UN-SDGs. The countries exhibiting high vulnerability to climate change contributed disproportionately fewer publications to the database. The United States emerged as the leading contributor in terms of publication volume, while Canada’s University of British Columbia was identified as the institution with the highest number of contributing authors. The findings underscore pronounced geographical disparities in research output, with a predominance of countries from the Global North. The underlying factors contributing to these disparities are discussed. Furthermore, the study discusses the policy implications of these findings and emphasises the imperative to prioritise equitable research initiatives. Such efforts are essential to effectively support the realisation of the SDGs within the domain of blue food systems and sustainability.

Rural Multidimensional Deprivation in Jharkhand: A Data-Driven Analysis 2024
in
Azim Premji University
Published
2025
Authors
School of Development
More
Abstract
This report constructs a Rural Multidimensional Deprivation Index (
RDI
) for measuring deprivation in Jharkhand. An important feature of the index is that it is constructed using indicators on provisioning of basic infrastructural amenities at the village level. This is different from the usual poverty indices that are composed of financial indicators such as income or consumption; or indicators measuring development outcomes such as educational or nutritional levels. Observing the provisioning of basic infrastructural amenities, this report makes focused policy suggestions that can be easily implemented by functionaries working on the ground. The data for the index is sourced from the Mission Antyodaya Survey, which was carried out in 2019 at the village level across the country. The survey collects data related to provisioning and outcome of basic amenities in villages, along with demographic and socioeconomic variables. Because this is a periodic survey, it enables us to track the developmental progress of each village, district, state and the country over time. In total, there are about 182 variables that were captured in the 2019 round. The survey covers 31,175 out of 32,620 villages in Jharkhand, which is 95.6 percent of the total number of villages in the state; and 6,48,358 out of 6,67,933 villages in India, or 97.1 percent of the villages in the country.

Building Capabilities of Informal Workers by Recognition of Prior Learning: The Current Practice and Alternatives
in
Azim Premji University
Published

Authors
Centre for Sustainable Employment
More
Abstract
Recognition of Prior Learning (
RPL
) is a key pillar of India’s Skill India mission under the National Policy for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (
NPSDE
) 2015, aimed at formalizing the skills of its vast informal workforce, which accounts for over 91% of total employment. By bridging the gap between experiential learning and formal certification,
RPL
has the potential to enhance employability, economic mobility, and workforce productivity. However, India’s
RPL
implementation faces significant challenges, including regulatory misalignment, limited industry adoption, and low stakeholder awareness, along with logistical barriers such as evidence verification and assessment costs. Primarily certification-driven, it lacks integration into the vocational training system, limiting its effectiveness as a pathway for skill advancement and higher income. Moreover,
RPL
is often used as a shortcut to boost certification numbers rather than as a tool for meaningful skill development. This paper examines the evolution, implementation, and impact of
RPL
in India using national labor force survey data while benchmarking it against global best practices from countries such as South Africa and the
UK
. The study identifies key policy gaps and proposes strategic recommendations to strengthen
RPL
, ensuring it transitions from a certification-centric model to a robust mechanism for workforce inclusion, quality vocational education, and sustainable skill development.

The Historical Evolution of Caste and Territorial Power: The Case of Jats in Punjab, India
Published
2025
Authors
Awanish Kumar
More
Abstract
This article presents a historical account of emergence and development of the territorial power of Jats in Punjab through analysing three elements. First, their historical appropriation of the village as their agrarian territory, which was often perpetuated under the discourse of
​
‘
village community’/clans and the monopolisation of the peasant identity. Second, the often-benevolent administration in Punjab during the colonial rule. Third, the development of a discourse of caste-progressiveness of Jats. The Punjab experience in this regard is significant to understand similar processes in other states and to make appropriate strategies for social movements and policy advocacy regarding agrarian/​social reforms.
Résumé
Cet article présente un compte rendu historique de l’émergence et du développement du pouvoir territorial des Jats au Pendjab en analysant trois éléments. Premièrement, leur appropriation historique du village en tant que territoire agraire, qui s’est souvent perpétuée sous le discours de la « communauté villageoise »/​clans et de la monopolisation de l’identité paysanne. Deuxièmement, l’administration souvent bénévole du Pendjab pendant la période coloniale. Troisièmement, le développement d’un discours sur la progressivité de la caste des Jats. L’expérience du Pendjab à cet égard est importante pour comprendre des processus similaires dans les autres États et pour élaborer des stratégies appropriées pour les mouvements sociaux et le plaidoyer politique concernant les réformes agraires/​sociales.

What is the value of value for agrarian studies?
in
Journal of Agrarian Change
Published
2025
Authors
School of Arts and Sciences
More
Abstract
Reflecting a longstanding intellectual heritage in Marxist political economy, contributions to agrarian studies have variously referred to the production, distribution and extraction of value. Despite this central role within the heritage of agrarian studies, the concept of value is often used inconsistently between authors and sometimes deployed without clear elucidation of the underlying theoretical tenets. As such, value often tends to be used more as a metaphor suggestive of conditions of exploitation rather than a detailed conceptual framework. In response, we must ask if there is still a robust case for value analysis forming a foundational pillar of agrarian studies? To address this challenging question, we invited three authors to give their perspective on the value of value for agrarian studies. First and foremost, we asked them to consider what value analysis does that is otherwise missed in critical agrarian studies and how we can mobilise its potential to sharpen analyses. Two further pivotal questions arise, spurred on by recent trends in the literature. First, to what extent do the categories of value enrich or hinder our evolving understanding of the dynamics of social reproduction within agrarian households and communities, including the gendered relations through which agriculture and livelihoods are performed? Similarly, are the largely anthropogenic concepts of value fit for the purpose of explaining environmental change and the more-than-human dynamics through which agricultural landscapes are produced and change over time?

Methodological Holism in Marx’s Capital Volume 1: The Conceptualisation and Measurement of Individual Units
in
Sage Journal
Published
2025
Authors
More
Abstract
This article aims to understand the methodological position that Marx takes in
Capital
Volume 1 and the implications of that on the individual units in his analysis. With the understanding that Marx adopts a fundamentally holist methodological standpoint, the article outlines how the individuals within classes and the system of capitalist production are measured and contextualised. This question is answered by examining Marx’s
Capital
Volume 1 as the primary text. Where relevant, the author engages with Marx’s intellectual background and tradition. The individual units discussed in this study are the commodity, the worker and the capitalist.
This article examines how the concept of the representative individual emerges through averaging and how this process unfolds in Marx’s
Capital
, shaped by his methodological approach. The article illustrates the method of averaging in Marx, through his intellectual engagement with Quetelet as it also focusses on Hegel’s influence on Marx’s method and elaborates on the parallels and divergences between them. With the given engagement with
Capital
and Marx’s intellectual interactions, we arrive at a specific understanding of holism that can be attributed to Marx in
Capital
Volume 1.

Abstract
“
Global learning crisis” narratives, in focusing on the
​
“
proximate determinants” of the crisis, represent a welcome
​
“
classroom turn” in international education and development. Extant learning crisis literatures are problematic, however, as their homogenizing gaze distorts how teachers and students co-constitute classrooms as locally meaningful learning spaces. Drawing on anthropological approaches in comparative education, this article addresses the
​
“
learning crisis” in a middle-school classroom in a weavers’ neighborhood in Kanchipuram. Constituted in an elaborate
​
“
notebook economy,” this classroom was an inventive response that not only accommodated students’ material cultures and social-educational disadvantages but also affected their belonging in a resource-scarce public education system. If the learning it afforded was disdained in
​
“
learning crisis” narratives, it was nevertheless relevant for students, readily translated into educationally unintensive assembly-line jobs. In producing contempt for such classrooms,
​
“
learning crisis” narratives merely distract from — and thus entrench — the deeply unequal economic and educational development that necessitated the notebook economy in the first place.

Abstract
Background
Mangrove species are vital to the ecosystems of tropical and subtropical coastlines worldwide. Despite the underexplored role of polyploidization in these species, deciphering its impact on gene expression is essential for understanding the connection between polyploidization and species diversification. Our initial investigation, integrating multiple nuclear loci with morphological and cytological data, indicates that the tetraploid
Acanthus tetraploideus
likely originated from allopolyploidization events involving the diploid species
A. ilicifolius and A. ebracteatus
. Expanding on these insights, this study utilises genome-wide evidence to confirm the divergence patterns among extant
Acanthus
mangrove diploids and to investigate the origin and transcriptome asymmetry of the tetraploid
A. tetraploideus
.
Results
Phylogenetic analysis and molecular dating revealed a closer evolutionary relationship between
A. ebracteatus
and
A. volubilis
than between
A. ebracteatus
and
A. ilicifolius
, diverged approximately 6.92 Mya and 9.59 Mya, respectively. Analysis of individual whole transcriptomes revealed that homeologous sequences in
A. tetraploideus
were preferentially clustered with
A. ilicifolius and A. ebracteatus
, rather than
A. volubilis
, in a roughly 1:1 ratio. The high similarity in nucleotide sequences and homologous polymorphisms between the tetraploid
A. tetraploideus
and its two parental diploids,
A. ebracteatus
and
A. ilicifolius
, supports the hypothesis of a recent allopolyploid origin for
A. tetraploideus
. Estimation of homeolog expression revealed a general attenuation of homeolog expression divergence in
A. tetraploideus
compared to the in silico parental mix, with 22.87% and 67.66% of genes exhibiting biased homeolog expression, respectively. Further investigation identified remarkable retention of parental expression dominance in the tetraploid, suggesting that parental genetic legacy substantially influences the reconfiguration of homeolog expression in the derived tetraploid. Meanwhile, the observation of numerous novel expression patterns between the two homeolog sets suggests that the transcriptome shock (i.e., the transcriptomic changes induced by interspecific hybridisation) associated with allopolyploidization and subsequent post-polyploid evolutionary processes also significantly impact transcriptome asymmetry in
A. tetraploideus
. While no strong evidence directly links transcriptomic changes to specific adaptive traits, the patterns in unbiased and novelly biased genes in
A. tetraploideus
suggest adaptations to stable polyploidy. Unbiased genes involved in fundamental cellular processes and novelly biased genes related to chromosome dynamics and cell cycle regulation may stabilise polyploid genomes, supporting the species’ establishment and long-term success. These findings underscore the role of transcriptomic stability in polyploid adaptation.
Conclusions
Our study sheds light on the evolutionary origins and the intricate transcriptional reconfiguration of the tetraploid
A. tetraploideus
. These insights significantly enhance our comprehension of the pivotal role that polyploidization plays in speciation and adaptative evolution of mangrove species.

Gendered inclusions and exclusions: Intersectional media discourses during the pandemic in India and the
USA
in
Springer Nature
Published
2025
Authors
More
Abstract
The
COVID-19
crisis created a period when an otherwise globalised world witnessed the rapid closure of local, national and international borders. Migrants, whose everyday lives, with or without the pandemic, are disrupted and defined by borders and their liminalities, were the most certain victims of these closures. All media platforms around the world reported on migrant workers, either villainising them as carriers of the virus or sympathising with them as victims of continued racist assaults and ruthless state policies. But what discourses dominated these media representations of migrants? Analysing over one thousand news reports on migrant precarity in India and the
USA
during the first two years of
COVID
, we see some patterns of gendered inclusion and exclusion. We find that even the seemingly pro-immigrant media discourses continued to emphasise migrants’ vulnerability, turning them into feminised props for larger political debates. In the process, the economic contributions of migrants across skill categories and often as
​
‘
essential workers’ remained invisible. The discourses also reproduced intersectional stereotypes, sometimes completely removing women, and often selectively magnifying or erasing their racial, ethnic and caste identities.

Capitalism, Competition and Class Conflicts: A Pedagogical Introduction to Marxist Political Economy
in
Sage Journal
Article
Published
2025
Authors
Srishti Yadav
More
Abstract
This article offers an introduction to Marxian economics for the uninitiated student or instructor. It first places Marxian economics within the surplus approach and ties Marx’s economic analysis with his theory of history, that is, historical materialism. The concepts of class, mode of production and antagonism are introduced. The article then discusses Marx’s analysis of capitalism. This is performed by first introducing the reader to the labour theory of value and then to the circuit of capital. The conflict between capital and labour and the conflict between capital and capital are explored around the question of technological change and innovation. This is followed by a brief discussion of the capitalist crises in the Marxian framework, after which the article concludes by presenting two strands of debate within Marxian economics.

Ecosystem services in the Alps: visitors’ perceptions of two alpine protected areas
in
Taylor & Francis
Published
2025
Authors
More
Abstract
Understanding users’ perception of natural areas and their ecosystem services is crucial for managers and policy makers as it directly informs decisions that balance conservation efforts with public acceptance. The alpine areas are particularly vulnerable to climate change, making it critical to understand how visitors perceive these areas to develop management strategies that minimize conflicts, helping to ensure long-term support for environmental protection. This study explores the perceptions of 21 ecosystem services – including cultural, regulating and provisioning services – among visitors of two protected alpine areas in Italy. We distributed 3,399 questionnaires to evaluate visitors’ perceptions of the importance of key ecosystem services, their awareness of the ecosystem services concept and any shifts in perception due to
COVID-19
, as the study took place during an ease of restrictions caused by the pandemic. Additionally, we explored the relationship between perceptions and demographic factors. Results showed that visitor strongly perceived the importance of the aesthetic value of the landscape and biodiversity conservation. Perception of the overall importance of
ES
was strongly correlated with demographic factors, such as gender, age and a connection to outdoor and naturalistic activities. Visitors who were already aware of the
ES
concepts exhibited higher perceptions compared to those who did not acknowledge them, suggesting the need for targeted communication strategies to extend the awareness of the
ES
concept. This data provides critical insights for managers and policymakers to tailor communication efforts, fostering greater public awareness and support for the benefits provided by protected natural areas.

MGNREGA
as a Technological Laboratory: Analysing Wage Payment Delays as a Result of Two Digital Interventions
in
Springer Nature
Published
2025
Authors
More
Abstract
The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (
MGNREGA
) is India’s rural employment guarantee programme that provides 100 days of work to each household and mandates payment of wages within 15 days of completion of work.
MGNREGA
has been subject to many technological interventions purported to improve efficiency and transparency. Many of these interventions were introduced without any consultation or scientific piloting resulting in violation of workers’ rights. We focus on two digital interventions. Firstly, in the financial year 2021 – 22, wage payments of workers were segregated based on their caste. Notwithstanding delays in wage payments, we find there is a statistically significant difference in the time taken to process payments across caste. This provides an empirical corroboration of how this move created caste tensions at worksites. Just in our sample, the compensation as per law that is payable to workers due to delays by the union government alone is ₹399 million. This is neither acknowledged nor paid. Secondly, we demonstrate that there is no statistically significant difference either in timely payment of wages or in payment rejections between the Aadhaar-Based Payment System (
ABPS
) and the standard account-based methods. Our analysis is based on 31.36 million transactions across 10 states from financial year 2021 – 22 crawled from the programme’s Management Information System. This is the first large-scale data-based evidence debunking officially stated claims of timely payments due to
ABPS
. We also examine official government circulars, documents retrieved using Right to Information responses combined with our immersive fieldwork to underscore our findings. In summary, we argue that any digital technology introduced in
MGNREGA
or any other social policy must be done through a consultative process, independent audits, giving centrality to workers’ rights.

Abstract
Some experts consider
​
“
food” as the most critical issue of the 21
st
century. Countries such as India are experiencing what has been described as a triple burden of malnutrition – characterised by high prevalence of undernutrition, obesity, and micro-nutrient deficiency. These are a result of inadequate access to healthy foods, increased use of highly processed foods, and low dietary diversity, besides factors related to sanitation. Changes in the practice of agriculture has resulted in a reduction in agrobiodiversity. The challenges to accessing food during shocks such as the
COVID-19
pandemic and conflicts in various parts of the world demonstrated the importance of local food security and reminded people of the importance of local food sources, including uncultivated or wild foods.

Lattice Engineering Triggered Phase Formation of Bimetallic Thiospinels with Excellent HzOR and
OER
Activity for Energy-Efficient Hydrogen Production
in
ChemCatChem
Published
2025
Authors
More
Abstract
Introducing foreign elements into a crystal lattice could trigger phase transformation, serving as an excellent means to fabricate highly electrocatalytic phases. NiCo2S4 is a notably electrocatalytic thiospinel phase, normally synthesized via two-step route and rarely explored for electrocatalytic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). This work reports one-step hydrothermal syntheses of NiCo2S4 and CuCo2S4 and their performance for HzOR and oxygen evolution reaction (
OER
). Time-dependent syntheses suggest formation of (M, Co)
9S8
; M=Ni/Cu phase, followed by conversion to the respective thiospinel phase. Computational study validates that the incorporation of Ni into Co9S8 disrupts its stability and induces the formation of a stable bi-metallic thiospinel phase. Even without the assistance of metal foam substrate, NiCo2S4 displayed remarkable activity for HzOR requiring potentials of 153 and 350 mV to afford current densities of 10 and 500 mA/​cm2, respectively. Furthermore, NiCo2S4 showed good activity for
OER
, providing 10 mA/​cm2 at 290 mV. For hydrazine-assisted
H2
production, the two-electrode setup, NiCo2S4||Pt/C attained a current density of 10 mA/​cm2 at 140 mV, which is 1.39 V less than that required for conventional water electrolyzer (1.53 V). Long-term durability of NiCo2S4 for both HzOR and
OER
at high current densities highlights the suitability of the catalyst for practical applications.

Accumulation by Dispossession: Evidence of Shrinking Space for Small-scale Fishers of Karnataka Coast
in
Springer Nature
Published
2025
Authors
More
Abstract
Small-scale fisheries play an important economic, social and cultural role in coastal Karnataka even today despite being subjected to several natural and anthropogenic stressors for a long time. They are neglected or even outright discouraged in the state’s fisheries policymaking, and their contributions to the state’s fish supply and their role in livelihood creation do not receive the due recognition. This paper is premised on the recognition of emerging stressors that pose a threat to the viability of small-scale fisheries. The impacts of these stressors have implications not only for the environment but also for nutrition, particularly among vulnerable populations, and the overall socio-economic stability of coastal communities that rely on fishing as a livelihood. The goals of this paper are to provide a thorough review of literature around these stressors, and to describe how these are being played out in coastal Karnataka. Among these stressors, we delve in depth on the new Blue Economy policy of India since it is likely to have severe antagonistic effects in combination with other anthropogenic stressors. Our opinion is, Karnataka has already started witnessing many of these ramifications of interventions/​stressors and the coastal landscape of the state is set to be transformed over the next couple of decades or so. Small-scale fisheries of the state are likely to be some of the most impacted communities from these interventions.

Household energy choices under fuel stacking scenarios: evidence for bundling welfare schemes for facilitating clean fuel use
in
IOP Publishing Ltd
Published
2024
Authors
More
Abstract
Energy poverty related to a reliance on traditional biomass for cooking has a strong association with environmental degradation, gender inequity and human health. Reduction of energy poverty is a growing concern in public policy agenda globally. In India, the last decade has seen concerted efforts to provide clean cooking fuel to the population. Despite this, wide regional disparities in energy poverty exist in India, indicating differential regional impacts of policies. A shift to universal access to clean modern cooking fuel requires the redesign of policies, with insights from a decentralized understanding of actual drivers of household cooking energy choices across diverse regions. The paper attempts to explain household cooking fuel choices under multiple fuel use (fuel stacking) scenarios in two states of India, differentiated by their socio-economic status and development trajectories. The paper employs multinomial logistic (
MNL
) regression on household level data from the Indian Human Development Survey 2015 to identify factors determining fuel choices. Urbanization,
per capita
income, the educational attainment of the household head and women in the household, having a separate kitchen for cooking and not living in one’s own house were observed to be positively influencing a switch to clean cooking energy in both the states. The results of the study indicate that shifting out of energy poverty and achieving the goal of universal clean cooking energy would require combining ongoing welfare policies with policies on provisioning clean cooking energy in India.

The Ontological Choreography of Conservation Practice at a Marine Turtle Rookery in India
in
Conservation and Society
Published
2024
Authors
More
Abstract
The Rushikulya beach in eastern India is considered to be an important rookery (nesting site) for a species of migratory marine turtle, the olive ridleys
Lepidochelys olivacea
, because it is one of a handful of sites around the world where an arribada or mass-nesting event occurs. During an arribada, thousands of ridleys nest simultaneously over a small section of the beach, and several weeks later, millions of hatchlings emerge from these nests and crawl into the sea. Given the uniqueness of this phenomenon, conservation programmes have emphasised the monitoring and protection of ridleys during an arribada. In Rushikulya, this involves an assemblage of multiple actors, including biologists, their local assistants, and staff of the Odisha Forest Department. In this article, I use the concept of ontological choreography, drawn from multispecies scholarship, to focus attention on how members of this assemblage bring together different ontological orders, mainly nature and the individual self, to protect the ridleys. Further, I use this concept to direct attention to the hybrid nature of conservation practice — that it can simultaneously be affective, embodied, performative, sensory and technical. Overall, this article demonstrates how multispecies approaches can enrich social studies of conservation.

Biography
Rajendran Narayanan is an Associate Professor in the School of Arts and Sciences. At Azim Premji University, he teaches in the economics programme and anchors the Occupational Track on
​
‘
Data, Democracy
&
Development.’ After completing his Ph.D in statistics from Cornell University, he has held academic positions at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, Cornell University, Ithaca and Ashoka University, Sonepat. In his doctoral work, he explored theoretical questions pertaining to eigenvalues of random matrices and shrinkage estimation in constrained regression problems. Since then, he has been more interested in research for action in social sciences.
He is keen on building bridges between research, advocacy and public engagement which led him to be a co-founder of LibTech India, which works with researchers, civil society organisations and governments across some states on improving transparency and accountability of rural social policies. He is part of national campaigns such as those involved in the promotion of constitutional values, human rights, right to work and food, etc.
Rajendran is also interested in demystifying economics and in understanding what the proliferation of data, and over-reliance on technological processes mean for citizenship and participatory democracy.

Analysis of Payment Delays and Delay Compensation in
MGNREGA
Azim Premji University,
April 2018
Read Online
Abstract
The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (
MGNREGA
) provides 100 days of work in a year for every rural household at a minimum wage. Because of
MGNREGA
, for the first time in the country, a transaction-based management information system (
MIS
) has been made available in the public domain, a feather in the cap of transparency. An essential safeguard in
MGNREGA
is delay compensation to be paid when workers do not receive wages within 15 days of completion of work. Despite several attempted measures, payment delays are rampant and the method of calculating delay compensation is flawed leading to massive under-calculation of the true payable compensation. By analysing over 90 lakh transactions for the financial year 2016 – 2017 across 10 states, we observe that only 21% of the payments were made on time and the central government alone was taking an average of over 50 days to electronically transfer wages. On aggregate, in our sample, while the true total delay compensation payable is about Rs. 36 crores, only about Rs. 15.6 crores is being calculated in the
MIS
. The Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) has acknowledged the correctness of the findings and the Supreme Court of India has also issued Orders to the MoRD based on these findings.

Political and Legal Institutions
An overview of the institutional structure and operation of governance in India.
Facilitator
Rajendran Narayanan
Specialisation
Political institutions
Two remarks by two eminent economists uniquely characterise India. Amartya Sen remarked that
​
‘
India is pockets of California in the middle of sub-Saharan Africa’. Joan Robinson had said that
​
‘
whatever you can rightly say about India, the opposite is also true.’ These compelling comments force us to think about economics from a more holistic perspective.
Despite a progressive Constitution and several landmark laws, India continues to be buttressed by various shades and dimensions of inequality. The four pillars of democracy – executive, legislature, judiciary, media – play an inescapable role in our daily lives as social, economic and political agents. The world at large, and India in particular, are at a critical juncture where the role and accountability of the State are undergoing complex changes.
While institutions and their norms provide a concrete structure to the State’s vision and action, the Constitution provides rights and legal safegaurds to individuals. This interplay between the State and citzens mediated through institutions and the four pillars of democracy provide a critical basis to understand fundamental questions about an individual’s power in society.
By placing the Constitution of India at the centre, this course tries to look at some aspects of democratic institutions. We look at the early years of nation-building throough institutions such as the judiciary, planning commission, and the election commission. It then takes a critical look at how the Constitution and the State have played out in the margins. Finally, we look at some landmark Court judgements and through the lens of the Right to Food, we analyse how the four pillars of democracy have fared. The Right to Food is a great example as it combines sound economic wisdom along with various social and poltical objectives enshrined in the Constitution of India.

The Constitution of India guarantees individual freedoms through its fundamental rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy articulate policies that can be undertaken by the governments to ensure these rights are honoured. Development initiatives through policies must ideally advance these principles. It therefore becomes important to interrogate how the development paradigms and policies that have been adopted have impacted socio-economic inequality and capacities of individuals. Therefore one needs to be in constant conversation with the triad of transparency, accountability, and participatory democracy vis-a-vis government programmes and actions. The first course of the Interdisciplinary Studies (
IS
) in
Data, Democracy and Development
called
​
“
Development as Freedom” will explore these ideas by anchoring the discussion on Amartya Sen’s capabilities approach.

Employment Guarantee during Covid-19
Azim Premji University,
October 2022
Read Online
Abstract
This study examines the performance of
MGNREGA
during the Covid-19 pandemic in eight blocks across four states of India, viz. Bihar, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.
MGNREGA
functioning is analysed along the following dimensions: overall impressions of the programme among job card holding households, extent of unmet demand, wage payments, changes in programme functioning during the pandemic, and effectiveness of
MGNREGA
as a safety net. The blocks were chosen from a list of blocks in which Civil Society Organisations part of the
NREGA
Consortium are working. All blocks on this list were ranked based on their performance in
MGNREGA
as reflected in the Management Information System (
MIS
). Highest and lowest ranked blocks were chosen in each state and are referred to as high performing and low performing blocks in the study The blocks chosen were — Phulparas (Madhubani) and Chhatapur (Supaul) in Bihar, Bidar (Bidar) and Devadurga (Raichur) in Karnataka, Khalwa (Khandwa) and Ghatigaon (Gwalior) in Madhya Pradesh, and Wardha (Wardha) and Surgana (Nashik) in Maharashtra. A two stage random sampling was followed in the chosen blocks. In the first stage, five Gram Panchayats (
GP
) were randomly chosen in each block based on the Census 2011 list. In the second stage, 50 households were randomly selected in each
GP
from the
MGNREGA
MIS
list of job card holders. The sampling method ensures representativeness of the results at the block level for all job card holding households. The survey was conducted in November-December 2021. Two reference periods were employed. The first covered the pre-Covid financial year (April 2019 to March 2020) and the second covered the Covid financial year (April 2020 to March 2021). This also includes executive summary of the report.

Lockdown, Migrant Workers, and the Inadequacy of Welfare Measures in India

Download
Abstract
On the 25
th
of March 2020, the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi, announced a nationwide lockdown to stem the spread of the novel Coronavirus,
COVID-19
. The decision, while imminent, was unplanned and unilaterally made without any consultation with the state governments. This has consequently caught millions of migrant workers and the bureaucracy off-guard, leaving them no time to plan for such an emergency. While millions of migrants successfully reached their home states, only to be quarantined in camps, many remain stranded far from home, with no money or food. We are therefore confronting a lethal combination of crises: health, hunger, sanitation, and trauma, both physical and psychological.

On the 25
th
of March the Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi, announced a nationwide lockdown to stem the spread of the novel Coronavirus,
COVID-19
.. The decision, while imminent, was unplanned and unilaterally made without any consultation with the state governments. This has consequently caught millions of migrant workers and the bureaucracy off-guard, leaving them no time to plan for such an emergency. While millions of migrants successfully reached their home states, only to be quarantined in camps, many remain stranded far from home, with no money or food. We are therefore confronting a lethal combination of crises: health, hunger, sanitation, and trauma, both physical and psychological.
On the 14
th
of April, the lockdown was extended by another three weeks to the 3
rd
of May. In his address to the nation, the
PM
barely acknowledged the unprecedented hardship caused by the brutal lockdown so far and treated India’s 400 million migrants, of which 0.6 million are in relief shelters and 2.2 million have been provided food, as if they were a miniscule minority —
​
“
kisi ko khaane ki pareshaani, kisi ko aane jaane ki pareshani, koi ghar parivaar se door hai” (Some are finding it difficult to eat, some are finding it difficult to move around, some are finding it difficult to be away from their families). In fact, the figures of 0.6 and 2.2 million, based on the status report filed by the government in the Supreme Court, are just another indication of gross underprovisioning for migrants during the lockdown. Migrant workers have lived and worked in the blind spots of our societal imagination. Scenes of their discontent and resistance against the lockdown and the sudden extension came to the fore recently in Surat and Mumbai as thousands gathered on the street. All they want is to be extricated from the continued trauma and helplessness and be able to go home; the most basic of human needs.
As we show in this report, the first three weeks of the lockdown have been utterly distressing for stranded workers and goes far beyond mere
​
“
pareshaani” as the
PM
put it. Despite the immense hardships that millions of stranded workers continue to endure, there was still no announcement on economic relief measures for them. Unless a combination of universal rations and money transfers, are implemented in letter and spirit, India is staring at alarming levels of destitution and despair.
Since the lockdown, some of us associated with campaigns on the Right to Food and the Right to Work have been constantly receiving distress calls from stranded migrant workers for food and cash from various parts of India.
We are calling ourselves
SWAN
: Stranded Workers Action Network and have been working since the 27
th
of March. What has stood out in the work so far is the initiative and urgency with which various civil society groups, individuals and a few officials have responded.

There is much to celebrate in terms of how internet technologies have democratised data availability and diluted the elitism surrounding data access. It has facilitated independent communication, helped in mobilising around civic issues and has played a significant role in building public consciousness around social, economic and political matters.  There are several notable examples of how information and Communication Technologies for Development (
ICTD
) have helped in improving the lives of marginalised communities.  However, many private agencies collect data using sophisticated algorithms. On most occasions, such algorithms are opaque and not open to public scrutiny. The proliferation of algorithms in diverse areas such as government policies, profiling, advertising, hiring in companies etc are reconfiguring our societies in complex ways. These in turn have profound consequences in widening the socio-economic divide, manipulating electoral outcomes, and fundamentally altering the level playing field in a democracy.  These prompt us to move beyond techno-utopianism and emphasise the need for a push towards constitutional propriety and accountability for technologies. Keeping these in mind, a critical interrogation of the politics and ethics of data, rooted in constitutional principles has assumed importance. A nuanced understanding of these is vital in thinking and building new technologies and data platforms that seek to liberate humans rather than confine. By placing constitutional values and institutional accountability at the centre, this course aims to interrogate whether data collection and technological choices are value neutral or political choices.  While Development as Freedom serves as the foundation course in building perspectives, the two skill courses on programming and statistical principles would ground the students in building the rigour to analyse data. This final course in the sequence helps in further polishing the need to keep in mind that data comes with politics on its back and that data and technologies are not value neutral entities.

Biography
After high school and undergraduate studies in Palakkad, Kerala, I took my MSc and PhD degrees from
IIT
Bombay and joined the World Bank in New Delhi as a statistician on the District Primary Education Programme in 1991, traveling across India to collect qualitative data and supervise field surveys. My engagement with the development sector in this role continued for several years. I then moved into the corporate world, working for over a decade in the global oil and gas industry. My return journey to academia was triggered by encounters with some contemporary writings on the history of mathematics. Since about 2015 I have occupied myself with questions like what is mathematics, does the Indian Ganita tradition count as mathematics, what is computation, and how do we model (our knowledge of) the world.
I am currently Visiting Professor at the National Institute for Advanced Studies (
NIAS
), Bangalore, where I am developing a programme on the mathematical heritage of India. In this programme, I am most interested in understanding the concepts of knowledge, hypothesis and evidence in different philosophical systems, and in particular, from the standpoint of
​
‘
computational positivism’. Focus upon the empirical vs the ideal has guided the shape of science historically into largely two distinct scientific cultures and the interaction between the two remains a central issue in modern science. The question of incomplete knowledge inevitably brings forth the question of probability. In that case, how should probability be defined? What about causality? What sort of exogenous information enters into causal inferencing, whereby correlation by itself cannot establish causation? I am curious about these questions of modern philosophy of science. I try to dig out the insights into the nature of knowledge as discussed (and debated) in ancient Indian works and link them to insights from the modern world. I find grist for my mill in diverse sources, from ancient Sanskrit and Malayalam texts to modern literary prose, classical music and developments in computer science.
Apart from this, I am very interested in statistical methods, and in extracting meaning from data. I pursue this interest through student projects. My teaching interests are also centred on the subjects of probability and statistics and allied topics.

Can a Machine Learn Democracy
Azim Premji University,
January 2021
Read Online
Abstract
E‑governance has changed the functioning of public programmes in India. In most cases, one technological platform is expected to perform multiple roles such as improving administrative efficiency, as an information repository for the beneficiaries and as a system for accountability. However, techno-solutionism can be incongruous to democratic principles. In this article, we highlight this by looking at some technologies, such as the Management Information System (
MIS
) among others, used for the implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (
MGNREGA
) in India. We illustrate how such technologies have been used to subvert legal rights of workers and critically examine whether these designs incorporate democratic values. We underscore that technological interventions, with compassionate design are potentially powerful tools for transparency, accountability, and grievance redressal. However, we argue that technology alone can neither enhance participatory democracy nor reduce socio-economic inequalities.

Applied Multivariate Statistics
This course aims to introduce the students to concepts and techniques of summarising, visualising the geometry, and analysing such dependent, multivariate data.
Facilitators
Shailaja Sharma
Rajendran Narayanan
Programme
MA in Economics
Specialisation
Statistics
Data in most disciplines are multidimensional in nature, be it field surveys pertaining to demographic details, socio-economic profile and preferences or financial market data, where stocks exhibit joint movement. To understand consumption behaviour, variables ranging from income to expenditure on a diverse basket of goods are collected. Understanding and extracting structures of dependence in higher dimensions requires sophisticated mathematical machinery. This course aims to introduce the students to concepts and techniques of summarising, visualising the geometry, and analysing such dependent, multivariate data. The methods can be applied to a wide array of settings where the assumptions on the data hold. The course will cover the following topics and techniques: Theory of Multivariate Normal Distributions, Multivariate Central Limit Theorem, Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis, Factor Analysis, Clustering Methods and Classification techniques.

Who is this for?
This course is designed for field professionals working in Civil Society Organisations, State Social Audit Units and other organisations working at the district level and below, with at least 2 years of experience working on issues related to local governance, social accountability and delivery of welfare entitlements
Why is this course relevant?
Social Accountability can be defined as
​
“
the obligation of those holding power to take responsibility for their behaviour and actions”. It has gained prominence over the last few decades in ensuring that local institutions act in compliance with their prescribed functions and protocols. Social accountability of local bodies like Gram Panchayats and other governance institutions is critical for ensuring that local governance in India is responsive, accountable and transparent.
The tools of social accountability have diversified over the years and their application has expanded to cover multiple schemes implemented by local agencies. This course intends to provide the participants a rigorous understanding of these tools of social accountability and their application in the context of schemes implemented through local governance units. The course introduces these tools in the context of local governance institutions in India by grounding the discussions in constitutional values and the practice of democracy in India. Participants will appreciate why and how the concepts of local governance and social accountability are interconnected and understand their importance in improving the effectiveness of local governance.
Pedagogy
The short course uses a mixture of pedagogical tools including lectures, debates, role-play, group reading and presentations, documentary films, field-work and assessments including peer review and reflections. The field-work for the course involves participants designing social accountability tools and implementing them in a field-stie, with the help of local coordinators.
Learning Objectives
The course aims to
Introduce the important tools of social accountability and their applicability and use in local contexts.
Enable participants to understand the deeper association between the practice of social accountability with constitutional values, democratic principles and sustainable development.
Building the capacities of participants to conduct, analyse and report on social accountability exercises in their roles effectively, and help them grow professionally in the development sector
Certification
Certificate of Participation will be issued to all participants after successful participation in all modules of the workshop.

This course introduces students to foundational theoretical and conceptual tools of Political Economy. It is the first in a two course Political Economy sequence. The central theme in both courses is power. The first part of the course develops theoretical foundations of class, caste, and gender as core relations of power in the Indian economy. The second part operationalizes the theoretical foundations from Part I in locations of power such as farms, factories, and homes, to explore how class, gender, and caste shape economic endowments and outcomes. The course covers both key theoretical foundational texts and recent empirical studies and requires students to engage with key datasets such as the Economic Census and the Situation Assessment Survey for agriculture.

Down and Out- The Gendered Impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on India’s Labour Market
Azim Premji University,
February 2021
Read Online
Abstract
The Covid-19 pandemic has created unprecedented disruptions in labour markets across the world including loss of employment and decline in incomes. Using panel data from India, we investigate the differential impact of the shock on labour market outcomes for male and female workers. We find that, conditional on being in the workforce prior to the pandemic, women were seven times more likely to lose work during the nationwide lockdown, and conditional on losing work, eleven times more likely to not return to work subsequently, compared to men. Using logit regressions on a sample stratified by gender, we find that daily wage and young workers, whether men or women, were more likely to face job loss. Education shielded male workers from job loss, whereas highly educated female workers were more vulnerable to job loss. Marriage had contrasting effects for men and women, with married women less likely to return to work and married men more likely to return to work. Religion and gender intersect to exacerbate the disproportionate impact, with Muslim women more likely to not return to work, unlike Muslim men where we find religion having no significant impact. Finally, for those workers who did return to work, we find that a large share of men in the workforce moved to self-employment or daily wage work, in agriculture, trade or construction. For women, on the other hand, there is limited movement into alternate employment arrangements or industries. This suggests that typical
​
‘
fallback’ options for employment do not exist for women. During such a shock, women are forced to exit the workforce whereas men negotiate across industries and employment arrangements.

Pandemic, informality, and vulnerability- Impact of
COVID-19
on livelihoods in India
Azim Premji University,
June 2020
Read Online
Abstract
We analyze findings from a large-scale survey of around 5000 respondents across 12 states of India to study the impact of
COVID-19
pandemic containment measures (lockdown) on employment, livelihoods, food security and access to relief measures. We find a massive increase in unemployment, an equally dramatic fall in earnings among informal workers, large increases in food insecurity, depletion of savings and patchy coverage of relief measures. Two-thirds of our respondents lost work. The few informal workers who were still employed during the lockdown experienced more than a fifty percent drop in their earnings. Even among regular wage workers, half received either no salary or reduced salary during the lockdown. Almost eighty percent of surveyed households experienced a reduction in their food intake and a similar percentage of urban households did not have enough money to pay next month’s rent. We also use a set of logistic regressions to identify how employment loss and food intake varies with individual and household level characteristics. We find that migrants and urban Muslims are significantly worse off with respect to employment and food security. Among employment categories, self-employed workers were more food secure. The Public Distribution System (
PDS
) system was seen to have the widest reach among social security measures. However, even under
PDS
, 16 percent of vulnerable urban households did not have access to government rations. Further, half of the respondents reported not receiving any cash transfers (state or central). We conclude that much more is needed in the way of direct fiscal support that has been announced thus far by state and central governments in India.

Abstract
The Covid-19 pandemic has created a need for high frequency employment and income data to gauge the nature and extent of shock and recovery from month to month. Lack of such high frequency household-level data from official sources has forced researchers to rely almost entirely on the Consumer Pyramids Household Survey (
CPHS
) conducted by the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (
CMIE
). Recently, the
CPHS
has been criticised for missing poor and vulnerable households in its sample. In this context, it becomes important to develop a detailed understanding of how comparable
CPHS
estimates are to other more familiar sources. We examine the comparability of monthly labour income estimates for the pre-pandemic year (2018−19) for
CPHS
and the Periodic Labour Force Survey (
PLFS
). Across different methods and assumptions, as well as rural/​urban locations,
CPHS
mean monthly labour earnings are anywhere between 5 percent to 50 percent higher than corresponding
PLFS
estimates. In addition to the sampling concerns raised in the literature, we point to differences in the way employment and income are captured in the two surveys as possible causes of these differences. While
CPHS
estimates are always higher, it should also be emphasized that the two surveys agree on some stylized facts regarding the Indian workforce. An individual earning
INR
50,000 per month lies in the top 5 percent of the income distribution in India as per both surveys. Second, both
PLFS
and
CPHS
show that half the Indian workforce earns below the recommended National Minimum Wage.

Structural Transformation and Employment Generation in India: Past Performance and the Way Forward
The Indian Journal of Labour Economics,
July 2022
Read Online
Abstract
Historical experience suggests that a sustained rise in per capita incomes and improvement in employment conditions is not attainable without a structural transformation that moves surplus labour from agriculture and other informal economic activities to higher productivity activities in the non-farm economy. In this paper, I analyse India’s performance from a cross-country comparative perspective, estimating the growth semi-elasticity of structural change. Using a cross-country panel regression, I estimate the effectiveness of growth in moving workers away from agricultural and informal activities as compared to other developing countries at similar levels of per capita income. I show that the performance in pulling workers out of agriculture is as expected given its level and growth of
GDP
per capita, but the same is not true for pulling workers out of the informal sector. I also propose the following five indicators that need to be kept track of when evaluating the growth process: the growth elasticity of employment, the growth semi-elasticity of structural change, the growth of labour productivity in the subsistence sector, the share of the organised sector in total employment and the workforce participation rate. Comparing these indicators across periods, states, regions or countries, allow us to understand which sets of policies have worked better than others to effective improvements in employment conditions. When taken together the indicators allow us to set structural change targets as well as to say whether the current pattern of growth is going to be sufficient to meet those targets.

Long-Run Performance of the Organised Manufacturing Sector in India- Aggregate Trends and Industry-level Variation
Azim Premji University,
May 2018
Read Online
Abstract
Despite its weak performance in terms of job creation in recent years, the organised manufacture sector remains vital to employment policy. This paper investigates the aggregate trends in this sector, in employment, output, labour-capital ratio, as well as wage share and wage rates at the three-digit
NIC
level over a long period from 1983 to 2016 using the Annual Survey of Industries data. We show that three distinct sub-periods can be identified within the overall period. Further, using shift-share decomposition we show that most of the decline in the L/K ratio can be explained by within industry changes. Finally, we analyze industries with respect to their capacity to deliver job growth as well as wage growth.

Indian and Chinese Economic Development in  Comparative Perspective
Facilitator
Amit Basole
This course introduces students to the similarities and differences between Indian and Chinese economic history, institutions and performance, emphasising the link between these three, a core feature of the
BA
curriculum. India and China are often spoken of together as two large emerging economies of Asia. However, in the last three decades, the two have diverged substantially as China has made the transition to a middle income economy while India remains much poorer. The course will equip students to carry out more nuanced comparisons between the two countries and also enable to identify where India can learn from the Chinese experience and where it cannot.

Did Employment Rise or Fall in India between 2011 and 2017- Estimating Absolute Changes in the Workforce
Azim Premji University,
August 2020
Read Online
Abstract
The recently released data from the 2017 – 2018 Periodic Labour Force Survey have created a controversy regarding the quantity of employment generated in the past few years in India. Estimates ranging from an absolute increase of 23 million to an absolute decline of 15.5 million have been published. In this paper we show that some of the variation in estimates can be explained by the way in which populations are projected based on Census 2011 data. We estimate the change in employment using the cohort-component method of population projection. We show that for men total employment rose but the increase fell far short of the increase in working age population. For women, employment fell. The decline is concentrated among women engaged in part-time or occasional work in agriculture and construction.

Labour Reforms in the Indian State of Rajasthan- a boon or a bane
Azim Premji University,
January 2021
Read Online
Abstract
The authors examine the impact of labour law deregulations in the Indian state of Rajasthan on plant employment and performance. In 2014, after a long time, Rajasthan was the first Indian state that introduced labour reforms in the Industrial Disputes Act (1947), the Factories Act (1948), the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act (1970), and the Apprentices Act (1961). Exploiting this unique quasi-natural experiment, the authors apply a difference-in-difference framework using the Annual Survey of Industries longitudinal data of India’s manufacturing establishments. Their results show that reforms had an unintended consequence of the decline in labour use. Also, worryingly, the flexibility resulted in a disproportionate decline in the directly employed worker. Evidence suggests that the reforms positively impact the value-added and productivity of the establishments. The strength of these effects varies depending on the underlying industry and reform structure. These findings prove robust to a set of specifications.

Macroeconomics
This course aims to prepare the groundwork for the study of Macroeconomics. The course uses a stock-flow accounting framework to introduce and analyze contending perspectives in macroeconomics. It equips the students with the alternative analytical frameworks that underpin and inform macroeconomic policy making in the context of modern financialized economies. In addition to the traditional theories of the determination of key macroeconomic variables such as output, employment, and inflation, this course introduces frontier topics such as real economy-financial economy interaction through stock-flow accounting approach and also some of the analytical tools such as the 3‑equation model for the analysis of monetary policy. The course is designed to serve as a foundational course for subsequent macro course such as Macroeconomics 2 (compulsory), Advanced Macroeconomics (optional) and Macroeconomics of Development (optional).

Entrepreneurship and Marginalised Social Identities in India
Economic and Political Weekly,
March 2024
Read Online
Abstract
The nature and extent of the under-representation of marginalised caste groups in enterprise ownership in India are examined. It is found that exclusion takes place in three distinct stages. First, the share of Scheduled Caste (
SC
), Scheduled Tribe (
ST
) or Other Backward Class (
OBC
) individuals in ownership of any enterprise is less than their share in the workforce. Second, among those who do engage in entrepreneurial activities, a disproportionately higher share of entrepreneurs from the marginalised identity groups are engaged in enterprises, which are not purely commercial and are likely to be subsistence-oriented. And finally, even within the owners of purely commercial enterprises, those from marginalised groups tend to be concentrated in the smaller enterprises and are severely under-represented in the larger and more productive ones.

This course builds on the first course in Political Economy by introducing students to various ways in which power has shaped global flows of labour, capital and goods through history. We start with colonialism and the construction of the modern global economy under European hegemony. The end of colonialism and the rise of sovereign states in Latin America, Asia and Africa is discussed next along with the implication of continued dominance of the advanced industrialised economies for independent national economic policy. The role of international financial institutions such as the
IMF
and the World Bank is emphasised. Finally, power in global value chains is introduced with examples such as garment and electronic supply chains. The course ends with the question of what the Chinese and Indian experiences tell us about the future of the global economy.

Regressive income shocks during
COVID-19
: Evidence from India
Azim Premji University,
August 2024
Read Online
Abstract
Studies based on the Consumer Pyramids Household Survey (
CPHS
) in India have shown that the impact of the Covid-19 lockdown on household incomes was progressive in nature — richer households suffered more. But several media reports as well as purposive surveys carried out during the pandemic suggest that the poor suffered more than the rich. We use nationally representative panel data for urban India from the official Periodic Labour Force Survey (
PLFS
) to show that households that were relatively richer prior to the start of the pandemic suffered relatively less during the lockdown compared to households that were poorer. That is, the shock was regressive in nature. We also confirm that, as per
CPHS
, richer households did indeed experience higher drops in income than poorer ones. But we show that this progressivity is much less than what prevailed prior to the pandemic. Thus the pandemic either disrupted ongoing progressive income changes or was outright regressive in its impacts.

Microeconomics
Most markets, especially in developing countries, operate with contracts that are, to some extent, unverifiable, unmeasurable or unenforceable. The first course in microeconomics set up a framework for analyzing markets with incomplete contracts using models of strategic interactions. The course begins with a review of game theory and then sets up models that incorporate features like repeated interactions, contingent renewal etc. to explain market exchange in the presence of incomplete contracts. It then proceeds to apply this general framework to models of insurance, credit and labour markets. Students will also read some empirical papers in these areas to understand some of the questions that these models try to answer.

Tracking Employment Trajectories during the Covid-19 Pandemic- Evidence from Indian Panel Data
Azim Premji University,
January 2021
Read Online
Abstract
Using the
CMIE
’s Consumer Pyramids Household Survey, we track a panel of households prior to the lockdown (in December 2019), during the lockdown (in April 2020) and afterwards (in August 2020) to investigate the employment and income effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and its associated containment measures. We identify four distinct employment experiences during the pandemic for those who were in the workforce just prior to the lockdown: no loss of employment (“No effect”), loss of employment followed by recovery (“Recovery”), loss of employment with no recovery (“No recovery”), and a delayed loss of employment (“Delayed job loss”). Overall, 54% of individuals experienced no job loss, while 30% lost work in April but recovered by August. 12% had not recovered employment as of August 2020. We analyse how these trajectories vary across different social and economic characteristics to quantify contractions and recovery in the labour market and the extent to which the vulnerabilities vary across different social groups, employment arrangements, and industries. We find that women were substantially more likely to lose employment as well as less likely to recover employment. Job loss was also more severe for lower castes as compared to intermediate and upper castes and for daily wage workers as compared to regular wage workers. Younger workers were particularly vulnerable to job loss compared to older workers. Having lost employment in April, younger workers were also less likely to recover employment in August. Finally, for those who were employed in both December 2019 and August 2020, we examine the changes in employment arrangements. We find a much greater frequency of transitions from wage employment to self-employment, more than that in the seasonally comparable period last year (Dec 2018 to Aug 2019). Our results call for urgent additional fiscal measures to counteract these effects.

Estimating the productivity gap between organised and unorganised small-scale units in India’s manufacturing sector
Azim Premji University,
June 2023
Read Online
Abstract
Small manufacturing firms are considered to be engines of growth and job creation. While most research on small firms focuses on formal sector units, in India informal sector units far outnumber the formal. This is true even for manufacturing units employing 5 to 49 workers, which constitute only 5% of all unorganised units, but in absolute numbers are nine times more numerous than organised units in the same size class. Such firms have the potential to contribute to structural transformation but their capacities vis-a-vis formal firms are not well understood. To address this, the researchers create a unit-level dataset combining Annual Survey of Industries data for organised (formal) units with the National Sample Survey data on unorganised (informal) units. They also discuss problems involved in this exercise and some ways to deal with them. They find that matching organised and unorganised units on observable characteristics reduces the labour productivity differences between them to around 25 percent. The researchers discuss some policy implications of their results.

How Comparable are India’s Labour Market Surveys- A comparison of
NSS
, Labour Bureau and
CMIE
Estimates
Azim Premji University,
May 2019
Read Online
Abstract
With the lack of official government data on unemployment and other labour market indicators, the most viable and recent source have been the regular household surveys conducted by the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (
CMIE
). Given the differences in methods in data collection, it becomes exceedingly important to establish some comparability between the government and the
CMIE
datasets. This paper attempts to do that using two methods. First we fit a model of employment status on the
CMIE
data and see how well it predicts outcomes in the older Labour Bureau 2015 – 16 and
NSS
2011-12 data. Then we compare state-level estimates of broad labour market indicators from
CMIE
2016 and Labour Bureau 2015 – 16 datasets. The broad results are that despite differences in methodologies, the estimates for men are quite comparable between the surveys, while measures of women’s participation in the labour force seem particularly sensitive to the way questions are asked in surveys.

Fiscal Transfers and Inflation- Evidence from India
Azim Premji University,
December 2019
Read Online
Abstract
Controlling for monetary policy, government transfers are potentially inflationary. This, however, may not be true when the economy is demandconstrained. Using a panel data of 17 Indian states over 30 years, we show that government transfers via welfare programs do not lead to inflation. For identification, we use a narrative shock series of transfer spending that is based on the introduction of new welfare programs. We then look at a specific program,
NREGA
, which has been shown to increase rural wages, and show that its implementation did not increase inflation.

Ankur is an ecophysiologist with a Master’s degree from Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Central Institute of Fisheries Education (
ICAR-CIFE
), Mumbai, and PhD in Biology from the University of Saskatchewan, Canada.
Prior to joining the University, Ankur worked at Dr. Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University (
RPCAU
), Pusa, Bihar for more than four years. Prior to that, he was a Postdoctoral Scientist at the University of Lethbridge, Canada.
Ankur’s current research is based on the principles of One Health, wherein he tries to understand the physiological effects of environmental contaminants on humans and other vertebrates through diets grown using contaminated water.
He studied how the mining effluents affect the health of the wildlife in the higher Canadian Arctic region. He also studied the extent of arsenic and cadmium accumulation from mining effluents in Arctic ringed seals and hare, an important part of the diet among Inuits and other indigenous tribes in the higher Canadian Arctic. As part of his research, he also studied the mechanistic underpinnings of behavioural toxicity in vertebrates using zebrafish as a model experimental animal.
At
RPCAU
, he researched the sustainable utilisation of scarce resources for aquaculture. He also studied the physiological effects of hypoxia, thermal stress, and pesticides in agricultural runoff in cultivable fish species.
As a trained fisheries professional, Ankur provides aquaculture consultations, especially in the mitigation of stress in fish.

Effect of fasting and re-feeding cycles on growth, glucose level, glycogen level, and digestive enzyme activity of Nile tilapia juveniles (Oreochromis niloticus) for cost-effective aquaculture
Springer Nature,
November 2024
Read Online
Abstract
The objective of this study was to assess the impact of short-term fasting and subsequent re-feeding cycles on compensatory growth performance, blood glucose levels, and digestive enzyme activity in mono-sex juvenile Nile tilapia (
Oreochromis niloticus
) over a 60-day period. A total of 150 juvenile Nile tilapia (Avg. wt. 9.34 ± 0.97 g) were allocated into five treatment groups: a control group (continuously fed) and four fasting groups —
T1
(1‑day fasting),
T2
(3‑day fasting),
T3
(5‑day fasting), and
T4
(7‑day fasting). Re-feeding occurred for 7 days in each group immediately following the fasting period in a recurring cycle. The average weight gain, specific growth rate, and feed efficiency ratio significantly (
p
< 0.05) declined starting from the
T3
group. Blood glucose levels during fasting significantly decreased starting from the
T2
group, but after re-feeding, they returned to levels comparable to the control group. The liver glycogen levels significantly (
p
≤ 0.05) decreased during fasting and completely recovered upon re-feeding, while muscle glycogen levels did not show any significant (
p
≤ 0.05) changes throughout the experimental duration. The activities of the digestive enzymes amylase and lipase significantly (
p
≤ 0.05) decreased during fasting starting from
T1
and
T2
groups, respectively, but after re-feeding, they returned to the levels seen in the control group. In contrast, the protease enzyme levels during the fasting period initially increased up to the
T2
group and subsequently returned to control levels in the
T4
group. The findings of this study indicate that only the groups that experienced very short fasting periods, specifically up to the
T2
group, attained body weights like the control group upon re-feeding due to compensatory growth. Therefore, this study concluded that implementing up to 3 days of fasting followed by 7 days of re-feeding in multiple cycles can serve as a strategy for minimizing input costs in tilapia farming.

Scholarly Insights into Sustainability, Climate Change,

Blue Food: A Perspective Aligned with Adoption of Sustainable Development Goals
Springer Nature,
July 2025
Read Online
Abstract
The increasing global demand for food, coupled with the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation, has shifted attention towards blue food systems. While these systems offer a potential solution to food security challenges, their sustainability is threatened by various factors, including overfishing, habitat destruction, and climate change. Recognising these challenges, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (
FAO
,
UN
) advocates for ensuring the sustainable contribution of aquatic food systems to global food security and nutrition, aligning with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (UN-SDG
s
). It was hypothesised that adoption of UN-SDG
s
would increase the interest of researchers in sustainability of fisheries and aquaculture. Therefore, a bibliometric analysis of the relevant literature published between 2000 and 2023 was conducted to test this hypothesis. The analysis revealed a significant rise in publications addressing climate change and sustainability after the adoption of the UN-SDG
s
. The countries exhibiting high vulnerability to climate change contributed disproportionately fewer publications to the database. The United States emerged as the leading contributor in terms of publication volume, while Canada’s University of British Columbia was identified as the institution with the highest number of contributing authors. The findings underscore pronounced geographical disparities in research output, with a predominance of countries from the Global North. The underlying factors contributing to these disparities are discussed. Furthermore, the study discusses the policy implications of these findings and emphasises the imperative to prioritise equitable research initiatives. Such efforts are essential to effectively support the realisation of the SDG
s
within the domain of blue food systems and sustainability.

This course brings together the tools of economic theory, mathematics, and statistical inference and applies it to the analysis of economic phenomena. It focuses on cross-sectional data analysis with a primary focus on linear regression. The course starts with the introduction of the classical linear regression model with emphasis on the ordinary least squares estimator and its properties and then moves on to the testing of hypotheses about the parameters in the classical linear regression model, large sample properties of estimators and test statistics, model selection and Binary dependent variable regression analyses. Students in the course will use the statistical software Stata to address real-world economic questions using nationally representative datasets to test economic theories and learn to determine the validity of the tests.

This course is designed as an elective for graduate students to introduce the science and economics of climate change. It aims to develop economic thinking and intuition applied to policy challenges associated with climate change. The course will examine the role of economics and policy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change, assess the national and international policy design and issues with current implementation, and survey the economic tools needed to evaluate current and future climate change policies. Through the course, students will learn to evaluate the effectiveness of market-based policy solutions to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions. The course also includes mitigation and adaptation policy applications in contemporary settings, with many examples embedded within the Indian context. They will also use the open-source statistical software R and globally gridded weather data to quantify the impacts of climate change on relevant economic outcomes and evaluate adaptation strategies to mitigate these impacts.

Viewed at the broadest level, physics studies natural phenomena, and searches for the general laws which govern them. The two extremes of scale, particle physics and cosmology as well as the more esoteric and speculative theories tend to dominate the public perception and the imagination of students, since they excite a sense of awe and wonder.
Between the two extremes lies physics at the human and terrestrial scale, which gives us an understanding of our everyday experiences, as well as forms the basis for the technology which increasingly dominates and transforms our lives.
A physicist’s way of thinking is not only useful in finding physical truths in other scientific fields but also offers an alternative (and now mainstream in many cases) to helping solve problems in economics, climate studies and social sciences.
Who should join us?
Our four-year rigorous programme is unique and opens up multiple academic or career possibilities for students. The study in physics is broad in scope while intense in the experiential aspect and social context. Besides the standard body of physics knowledge, we inculcate a unique way of thinking through our hands-on learning experience both in the classroom and laboratory. If you have an inclination towards this kind of approach, this is the programme for you.
Why study with us?
We offer Interdisciplinary Openness
Our programmes encourage you to explore and follow your interests. We design our courses to ensure that you can specialise in a subject of your choice while learning various subjects across disciplines.
A Common Curriculum for all students
You will meet all your classmates at the beginning of your course to build all the tools you need for your four years of study. This includes foundational courses, an understanding of India, interdisciplinary studies, and courses in
creative expressions
.
We provide Academic Assistance
Our consistent academic assistance through language support, peer tutoring, faculty mentorship, etc., ensures that you meet the programme’s academic requirements.
We ensure Financial Support
We extend need-based financial assistance to students that cover tuition and accommodation expenses.
Programme Structure
Course Structure
Common Curriculum
The Common Curriculum will introduce students to the study of the themes and areas that emphasise and build critical and analytical abilities, and sensibilities for dialogue, reflection and cooperative learning. The Common Curriculum has four sub-components organised as below:
Academic Reading and Writing:
Introduces students to domain specific reading and writing skills
Creative Expressions:
Students are empowered to participate with meaningful social connection, fostering a community of active and responsible citizens
Public Reasoning/​The World of Computing:
The students will do one of the two courses.
Public Reasoning: Introduces students to the practices of understanding as well arguing for claims in the public realm.
The World of Computing: This enables students to explore the potential of computing devices and computational reasoning
Understanding India:
India’s history, society and possible future.
Disciplinary Major
We offer broad introductory courses for you to have a good foundation and clear understanding of mechanics, electricity, heat, light and wave phenomena. These courses have an integrated tutorial and laboratory component.
These courses sometimes require an understanding of other scientific disciplines, and to ensure that you are able to study with ease, we offer you
supportive
courses in methods, chemistry, mathematics and biology.

Occupational Minor
Students must be prepared for the world of work at the end of the programme should they choose to enter it. We aim to provide the required skills and competencies for this through a Minor featuring courses in an
Occupational or Interdisciplinary theme.
These sets of courses are aimed to provide both conceptual understanding and skills and tools that will allow students to contribute through work and further study.
Students can opt for a Minor in any one of the indicative areas listed below.
The selection of these indicative areas is based on the availability of courses and our evaluation of the student’s interests and academic needs. For each cohort, a final list of available courses will be announced at the end of their second semester.
Music Education
The undergraduate Occupational Track programme in Music Education is designed in collaboration with SaPa, the Subramaniam Academy of Performing Arts. SaPa is on a mission to make quality music education accessible to all. A large part of this involves creating enough music teachers to build the ecosystem for music education, and creating certifications and knowledge sets to make music teachers employable, both in schools and at music institutions.The Music Education OT aligns with this objective and aims to offer students an understanding of music itself, and how music may be taught in different environments. This will help students be employable,…

Sports and Fitness
We believe that a regimen of physical activity can have a powerful effect on an individual’s physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Sport can be used as an effective tool to help an individual learn crucial life skills and also to build an empathetic, equitable community. In these set of courses, we want you to have a powerful experience of sport not just as a physical activity but as a way to build yourself and your social surroundings. We also want to teach you ways in which you can create these transformational experiences for others.

Students will have the option to take additional courses in their Disciplinary Major.
Interdisciplinary minor that will enable them for their further higher studies or career pathways.
These courses could also be selected to enhance and broaden their
Language skills and Quantitative reasoning capacities/​​programming skills.
Understanding of themes outside their Major subject.
Classroom Practices
Students learn how to take responsibility for their own learning. Many classes are run in studio format, where instruction comprises lectures, lab demonstrations, and doing experiments in groups. Building experiments with one’s own hands and experiencing phenomena up close are as essential as problem solving and doing simulations in our courses. Independent projects give students a flavour for doing research.

Biography
I trained as an experimental physicist, and my world-view and approach to a problem are geared towards such an inquiry and process. My doctoral (IISc, Bengaluru) and post-doctoral work (
KTH
, Stockholm) were in the field of semiconductor processing and characterization. My current investigations are in the general area of stochastic or random processes, such as traffic and transportation, using computational and machine learning tools. I like to find the little ways in which science applies in daily life and strive to make its methods and instruments accessible to students or general public.
Technology and the medium of films interest me. An overview of my activities may be found at http://​murthy​ovsn​.net.

Have you ever loved or hated a subject? Was it because of your teacher?
Have you ever wondered about the role of teachers in society?
Good teaching can ignite curiosity, inspire learning, and make a lasting impact on the lives of children.
Our dual-degree BSc BEd programme prepares you to become a thoughtful and caring teacher of science or mathematics in school. You would develop sound theoretical knowledge in your science discipline and practical grounding in your knowledge, skills, and dispositions as an educator.
Who should join us?
We offer a variety of courses through which you would learn about challenges, debates and opportunities in education, how to teach specific school subjects in effective and engaging ways, as well as explore and hone your capacities as a responsive teacher in real-world classrooms from schools in different parts of the country.
The curriculum places equal emphasis on subject rigour and effective classroom practices, which would enable you to opt for careers in teaching, education research and practice, as well as scientific research and practice. Listen to our faculty talk about the programme.
Through the courses, you would engage with fundamental questions like ​“How do children learn?” and ​“What is important for children to learn?”
We would help you build skills such as effective voice modulation, creative use of space in a classroom as well as on a blackboard, and research-based practices to inspire and engage your learners. We would also guide you to develop empathy and relational capacities with children and people from diverse contexts. Listen to our students explain how the programme is designed.
A highlight of our programme is the structured and supported opportunities we provide for you to integrate your classroom learnings with teaching practice through a set of school internships. Hear about the rich and varied experiences from our alumni on their transformation from students to teachers.
Teaching is a uniquely rewarding profession. We closely guide and mentor our students through the programme, and we offer active support to our alumni who become teachers, especially in their initial years of teaching.

We go deeper into the inner workings of our body through more physical practices and also focus on how the practice of physical activity is changing you as a person. Is the change only physical or are there other areas that one can feel a perceived change? By answering these questions for ourselves we move towards the idea of teaching a physical practice and how it can be done.

How do emerging economies such as India grapple with the demands of growth and looming environmental crises?
In an age of automation and Artificial Intelligence, what is the nature and centrality of work in people’s lives? Can we envision a world without work?
These are some of the crucial challenges confronting India and the world. These questions can be best understood and grappled with through an interdisciplinary study of Philosophy, Political Science, and Economics.

Programme Structure
Course Structure
The biology major at Azim Premji University seeks to provide a modern, liberal education in the life sciences with a strong connection to India. Students in the major receive an integrated view of biology, develop an understanding of how it is related to other scientific disciplines and become aware of how life sciences can be applied to address problems in India. The curriculum of the major is designed to develop capacities for critical thinking and quantitative reasoning and impart experimental and analytical skills. In both its conception and its design, the curriculum challenges the traditional view of biology as descriptive and non-mathematical.
Common Curriculum
The Common Curriculum will introduce students to the study of the themes and areas that emphasise and build critical and analytical abilities, and sensibilities for dialogue, reflection and cooperative learning. The Common Curriculum has four sub-components organised as below:
Academic Reading and Writing:
Introduces students to domain specific reading and writing skills
Creative Expressions:
Students are empowered to participate with meaningful social connection, fostering a community of active and responsible citizens
Public Reasoning/​​The World of Computing:
The students will do one of the two courses.
Public Reasoning: Introduces students to the practices of understanding as well arguing for claims in the public realm.
The World of Computing: This enables students to explore the potential of computing devices and computational reasoning
Understanding India:
India’s history, society and possible future.
Disciplinary Major
Core courses are compulsory set of 11 courses that a student majoring in Biology has to take. The courses provide a rigorous and integrative exposure to the life sciences. Students will explore phenomena at multiple length and time scales (from molecules to ecosystems). This integrative exposition will be enabled by well-crafted pedagogic techniques and a thoughtful combination of classroom-based and experiential learning.

Engagement
Full-time
The undergraduate programme in History at Azim Premji University brings together a committed and critical engagement with the myriad pasts of the peoples in the Indian subcontinent alongside a vision of transformative social change via education.
In this endeavour, the History programme marks a pedagogic departure from the typical ways in which the subject is taught in school contexts, where rote learning of historical facts is privileged.
The History curriculum at Azim Premji University aims to develop amongst students critical and methodologically rigorous ways of understanding and interpreting the past in all its complexities and pluralities. We emphasise that the past, regardless of whether we see it as continuous or as marked by ruptures, is always contentious. And nowhere is this more apparent than in India, where the past is also always present.
In India, we encounter these varied contested pasts in our everyday lives. The History
programme
aims to inculcate historical consciousness amongst its students. It prepares students to examine the past in a clear, comprehensive, and critical manner.
Our courses will familiarise students with different periods and themes within Indian history. We train students to examine historical arguments and claims independently to assess their validity. Students are exposed to a range of primary sources, such as inscriptions, texts, architecture, archaeology, and archives. We also teach students to communicate History in diverse contexts and across different platforms, while relating to it based on their own lived experiences.
Who should join us?
At Azim Premji University, join us if you wish to learn both Indian and World History, focusing on several fascinating themes along the way. The programme is open to students from all disciplinary backgrounds. All you need to bring with you is curiosity about the past and a desire to learn for yourself the historian’s tools.
Why study with us?
We offer Interdisciplinary Openness
Our programmes encourage you to explore and follow your interests. We design our courses to ensure that you can specialise in a subject of your choice while learning various subjects across disciplines.

means that students are encouraged to frame problems, identify the assumptions,
axioms and definitions required and then proceed to derive results or theorems
and thus engage in mathematical discovery. These practices are further grounded
in learning behaviours encouraging discussion, sharing, collaboration and are
designed to erase differences of background, linguistic ability, gender
differences, etc. among the students.
Classroom
work is supported by experimental, modelling and computational activities in
the vibrant Mathematics Studio. Most courses of study have lectures, tutorials
and lab components. Computer programming is taught at an early stage. Students
are encouraged to take up project work, where the faculty mentor them.
Students
learn in a conducive atmosphere with opportunities for multiple modes of
learning and expression at every stage.

Literature in the English language is a whole world, full of craft and aesthetic and forms that tell us stories. These stories speak of the worlds in which we live: different places and experiences, and many perspectives. In this
programme
, we take you through an exploration of literature in the English language — written in English, translated into English, from different times, in different forms and via different media. Through this exploration of the written word and oral expression we hope you learn to love literature as a way of reflecting on our lives.
Who should join us?
If you are considering a career as a writer or an editor
If you aim to polish your English as a broad foundation for success
If you love escaping into novels and short stories

If you are intrigued by the way literature reflects history and society

Occupational Minor
Students must be prepared for the world of work at the end of the programme should they choose to enter it. We aim to provide the required skills and competencies for this through a Minor featuring courses in an
Occupational or Interdisciplinary theme.
These sets of courses are aimed to provide both conceptual understanding and skills and tools that will allow students to contribute through work and further study.
Students can opt for a Minor in any one of the indicative areas listed below.
The selection of these indicative areas is based on the availability of courses and our evaluation of the student’s interests and academic needs. For each cohort, a final list of available courses will be announced at the end of their second semester.
Music Education
The undergraduate Occupational Track programme in Music Education is designed in collaboration with SaPa, the Subramaniam Academy of Performing Arts. SaPa is on a mission to make quality music education accessible to all. A large part of this involves creating enough music teachers to build the ecosystem for music education, and creating certifications and knowledge sets to make music teachers employable, both in schools and at music institutions.The Music Education OT aligns with this objective and aims to offer students an understanding of music itself, and how music may be taught in different environments. This will help students be employable,…

Sports and Fitness

Sport can be used as an effective tool to help an individual learn crucial life skills and also to build an empathetic, equitable community. In these set of courses, we want you to have a powerful experience of sport not just as a physical activity but as a way to build yourself and your social surroundings.

Is all intelligence in the mind or is there bodily intelligence? How can we be more aware of our body and build on the knowledge our body already possesses? We will be working on these questions and many others in this course. We will be bringing our attention to our bodily experiences in individual and team sport activities while also focusing the practice of emotional regulation, reflecting on our gendered habits, individual inhibitions, and motivations through discussions and dialogue.

Playing a team sport is equal parts about the team and the sport. Learning the skills of the game is only half the job done. Working with a group of humans can be a complex exercise under any circumstances (not just sport). But can we use sport to learn how to work with a bunch of fellow humans? Sport can mimic life in many ways and give us a low stakes environment to make mistakes and learn from it. If we get good at this game, we could also get good at building caring and empathetic social surroundings for ourselves and others. We will be exploring these aspects of sports while having fun playing a sport called ’ Ultimate Frisbee’.

Chemistry is the science of matter and the transformations it can undergo. It embraces everything in the material world around us — the environment we live in, our bodies, the food we consume, the chips in our computers, the energy that makes the world function, and the lifesaving drugs that prolong our lives.
Our programme provides a holistic, modern, and liberal education in chemistry. The courses in the chemistry major have been designed in such a way that they teach students to think like chemists. We recognise that chemistry is more than just the properties of chemicals and that an understanding of how chemistry works is more important than knowledge of the facts of chemistry.
Who should join us?
At Azim Premji University, join us if you are looking for a programme that incorporates a strong experimental (and computational) component in every course that teaches students the art and science of observation and manipulation of materials.The core themes of our programme intend to reflect the way a chemical scientist thinks in the laboratory.
Structure and Analysis: What is a substance made of?
Synthesis and Reactivity: How do I make it and how do I change it?
Model Development: How do I explain its behaviour and properties?
The core foundational courses are organised along these themes and integrate topics from all the subdisciplines of chemistry including physical, inorganic and organic chemistry.
As students, you will work in laboratories equipped with advanced spectroscopic, analytical and synthetic equipment early in their coursework. The early exposure to research and experimentation in courses and the optional honours research project will equip you with the capacity to be self-directed learners and excel in any future career path that you may choose — inside or outside the scientific research world.
Why study with us?
We offer Interdisciplinary Openness
Our programmes encourage you to explore and follow your interests. We design our courses to ensure that you can specialise in a subject of your choice while learning various subjects across disciplines.
A Common Curriculum for all students
You will meet all your classmates at the beginning of your course to build all the tools you need for your four years of study. This includes foundational courses, an understanding of India, interdisciplinary studies, and courses in
creative expressions
.
We provide Academic Assistance
Our consistent academic assistance through language support, peer tutoring, faculty mentorship, etc., ensures that you meet the programme’s academic requirements.
We ensure Financial Support
We extend need-based financial assistance to students that cover tuition and accommodation expenses.

Incorporating research, observation and experimentation skills, early interdisciplinary and collaborative research practice are some of the key considerations.
The chemistry programme aims to take students from a diversity of socio-economic and educational backgrounds through a four-year rigorous undergraduate programme that opens up multiple academic or career possibilities. On the one hand, while enabling a wide range of future options, accessibility and inclusivity form the core of the programme from a societal perspective.
Features
Honours Projects
The honours with research or internship section of the curriculum prepares students to further deepen their understanding and capabilities and allows for different pathways into higher education or entry into the workforce.
Students interested primarily in the higher education pathway would be expected to do a semester-long independent research project, resulting in a thesis submission in the four-year programme.
The research honours pathway is designed to give qualified students an opportunity to engage with chemistry research more intensively. Through the project, students receive rigorous training in posing scientific questions, conceptualising testable hypotheses, conducting experiments, and documenting their results in the form of presentations and a final written thesis.
In the Chemistry Research Seminar course for 3 credits, developments and techniques in chemistry are discussed by selecting journal articles from current literature. Students will be able to use the seminar course to augment the skills developed through the research project by researching chemical literature, critically reading and evaluating scientific journal articles, and making scientific seminar presentations.

Forever surrounded by mysteries of life, some things become so obvious that they are hidden from us. How do you know that you aren’t dreaming?

The four-year
BA
Social Science programme at Azim Premji University offers students a broad-based, multi-disciplinary immersion in the study of Indian society — its structures, institutions, and lived realities.
The vision for the major is grounded in the conviction that at a time when our society appears to be increasingly fragmented and fractured, higher education in the social sciences, especially at the undergraduate level, ought to approach the
​
‘
social’ in an integrated fashion.
This requires putting theoretical and methodological practices of the traditional social science disciplines like sociology, anthropology, history, political science, etc., into conversation with each other, such that they best illuminate our social condition for both critical analyses and transformative action.
Accordingly, the
BA
Social Science curriculum provides students with a wide-angle exposure to the fundamental theories, concepts, and methodologies in the social sciences, cutting across disciplinary boundaries. It trains them to bring this learning to bear on specific objects of social scientific enquiry, especially in the Indian context, through hands-on fieldwork experience. And, in conjunction with the other facets of the undergraduate programme, it develops in them the technical skills necessary for collating and analysing empirical data of both qualitative and quantitative kinds.

Engagement
Full-time
Digital technology has pervaded many aspects of our personal and professional lives. The technology landscape is constantly changing and the power and potential of digital technology are only going to increase. On the one hand, there is a lot of scope for creatively using this potential to address challenges faced by citizens and society at large. On the other hand, indiscriminate use of digital technology is likely to have negative consequences.
We focus on providing a programme that foregrounds the use of technology in the public sphere and adopting an approach that prepares students for a future where the current becomes obsolete and yet, their learnings guide them forward.
Graduating practitioners should not only be skilled at identifying and formalising ways to address problems, but have the sensibility and ability to engage with multiple stakeholders with conflicting requirements and also have the capacity to learn, adapt and modify technologies to their context.
We, at Azim Premji University, with our commitment to engage with social issues, provide this kind of technology education. Moreover, our four-year undergraduate programme structure with its common curriculum and occupational tracks is well-suited for a unique programme in computing technology education.
Who should join us?
The BSc in Information Sciences programme seeks to aid graduating students in addressing public challenges by using technology ethically and conscientiously. While the programme will be grounded in computer science, it will differ from existing ones in at least three respects.  It will
encourage students to view digital technology critically. Students will engage with questions of accessibility and affordability and be made aware of limitations and negative consequences (including technology addiction).
emphasise a problem-centric approach to the use of technology and will discourage the use of technology for technology’s sake.
focus explicitly on graduating students who are reflective in their approach to technology and are capable of self-learning.
Why study with us?
We offer Interdisciplinary Openness
Our programmes encourage you to explore and follow your interests. We design our courses to ensure that you can specialise in a subject of your choice while learning various subjects across disciplines.
A Common Curriculum for all students
You will meet all your classmates at the beginning of your programme to build all the tools you need for the four years of study. This includes foundational courses, an understanding of India, interdisciplinary studies, and courses in
creative expressions
.
We provide Academic Assistance
Our consistent academic assistance through language support, peer tutoring, faculty mentorship etc., ensures that you meet the programme’s academic requirements.
We ensure Financial Support
We extend need-based financial assistance to students that includes tuition and accommodation expenses.
Programme Structure
Course Structure
As with other disciplinary majors, students will be required to complete 12 courses to qualify for a degree. Of these, 9 will be core courses divided into four themes. The remaining three will constitute a track that will enable students to gain more specialised skills. Students opting for a project related to their major in their 7
th
semester will also take a 3‑credit seminar course on Technology and Society.
In addition to these courses, students may take electives in the major through their flexible credits.
Common Curriculum
The Common Curriculum will introduce students to the study of the themes and areas that emphasise and build critical and analytical abilities, and sensibilities for dialogue, reflection and cooperative learning. The Common Curriculum has four sub-components organised as below:
Academic Reading and Writing:
Introduces students to domain specific reading and writing skills
Creative Expressions:
Students are empowered to participate with meaningful social connection, fostering a community of active and responsible citizens
Public Reasoning/​​The World of Computing:
The students will do one of the two courses.
Public Reasoning: Introduces students to the practices of understanding as well arguing for claims in the public realm.
The World of Computing: This enables students to explore the potential of computing devices and computational reasoning
Understanding India:
India’s history, society and possible future.
Disciplinary Major
We have organised the nine Disciplinary Major into four themes:
Perspectives (one course):
The first course in the curriculum will require students to look at how they use technology in everyday life and how digital systems are built. They will also be introduced to thinking systematically and formally about problems inspired from everyday experience.
Theoretical and Mathematical Foundations (two courses):
Two courses in discrete mathematics and algorithms will build essential foundations for the courses in the programming and the systems themes.
Programming Foundations (three courses):
Through a set of three courses, students will learn the principles of programming along with basic problem-solving, an understanding of data organisation and application development (with support for Indian language scripts).
Systems (three courses):
This set of three courses will allow students to understand machine internals, the fundamentals of databases, operating systems and networking, and how transformational systems are used to link different levels of computation.
Tracks (three courses):
The idea of tracks is to allow students to engage with current technology in the context of addressing public challenges. While we have imagined several potential tracks, the actual offerings will depend on the cohort size and faculty availability. The tracks we will offer would have a natural pairing with an occupation track or a disciplinary minor so that we can leverage the structure of our undergraduate programme to the fullest extent. Students will benefit from the synergy between their major track and their occupational track/​minor. Here are the tracks we have envisaged:
Graphics and computer vision (with applications in Education)
Embedded systems and Sensor Networks (with applications in Environmental monitoring)
Application Development (with applications in Health
ICT
,
CSE
)
Security and Data Privacy in the social sector
AI
(
ML
&
Natural Language Processing (in the context of Indian Languages)
Technology and Society:
Students who choose to undertake a project in their seventh semester will be required to take this course. This course will look at issues of accessibility, affordability, inclusiveness and the impact of digital technology. Students may also carry out some field work to recognise resource constraints and other technological challenges in the Indian context.

Occupational or Interdisciplinary theme.
These sets of courses are aimed to provide both conceptual understanding and skills and tools that will allow students to contribute through work and further study.
Students can opt for a Minor in any one of the indicative areas listed below.
The selection of these indicative areas is based on the availability of courses and our evaluation of the student’s interests and academic needs. For each cohort, a final list of available courses will be announced at the end of their second semester.
Music Education
The undergraduate Occupational Track programme in Music Education is designed in collaboration with SaPa, the Subramaniam Academy of Performing Arts. SaPa is on a mission to make quality music education accessible to all. A large part of this involves creating enough music teachers to build the ecosystem for music education, and creating certifications and knowledge sets to make music teachers employable, both in schools and at music institutions.The Music Education OT aligns with this objective and aims to offer students an understanding of music itself, and how music may be taught in different environments. This will help students be employable,…

Flexible Courses
Students can craft their own educational experience by selecting courses in the following ways:
Students will have the option to take additional courses in their Disciplinary Major.
Interdisciplinary Minor that will enable them for their further higher studies or career pathways.
These courses could also be selected to enhance and broaden their
Language skills and Quantitative reasoning capacities/​​programming skills.
Understanding of themes outside their Major subject.
Classroom Practices
While the core curriculum will be superficially similar to comparable programmes offered elsewhere, our pedagogic approaches and our assessment methods will be unique. For example, we are clear that when we introduce technological tools in courses, we will do so based on pedagogical principles (those that illustrate the concepts being taught most effectively) rather than expedient ones (what is fashionable). We are confident that students can pick up new tools if their fundamentals are strong. Moreover, assessments will involve addressing public problems rather than esoteric computer science questions. To complement the core curriculum, students will opt for a track of three courses, which will allow them to engage with current technologies in a domain of their choice.
Programme Features
The curriculum of the BSc in Information Sciences programme will inculcate the following capacities and dispositions:
Strong Computing-Science Foundations
The field of computing is dynamic with a high tempo of change. Within four decades, we have seen four major revolutions: the internet, digital, social-networking, and emergent artificial intelligence (
AI
).
Students need a well-founded base in the science and mathematics of computing that can outlive and support the high tempo of technology and cultural shifts that the world is going through. Only a deep grounding in scientific foundations can provide a substrate for a stable mindset amidst these movements.
Towards this, we have identified several
​
“
ways of thinking” and
​
“
ways of doing” that will be essential for students to acquire. This includes becoming adept with programming, having the ability to reason formally about problems, and being comfortable with abstractions and thinking about digital systems spanning multiple levels (from hardware components to high-level code).
Technical competence
Students graduating from the programme should be comfortable with identifying, adopting and customising appropriate technological tools. In other words, the programme will bring about expertise in the use of computational techniques in general and also current technology skills — some through teaching, some through labs, and a lot through an ambient culture that supports self-learning.
Sensitivity to social issues
Students need to be aware of the challenges that the country needs to address and develop an understanding of how digital technology can assist in mitigating these challenges. The common curriculum in the first year prompts students to engage with social issues in India in a multi-faceted way. The perspectives built through the common curriculum will provide the foundation for students to look at technology in the context of addressing public issues. Sensitivity to social issues coupled with a dovetailing of computational attitude in a pervasive way through the entire curriculum will bring a precision and an algorithmic approach towards formulating and proposing solutions to these challenges.
Flexible and constructive attitude
Students will be encouraged to identify creative solutions to problems and to come up with working implementations of these solutions (thinking
​
“
outside the box”). When it comes to adopting technology, we would like our students to tinker with and explore the
​
“
internals” (thinking
​
“
inside the box”).
Students should be open to evaluating and learning new technological tools while having the keenness to understand how they work and the persistence to engage with these tools even in the face of challenges. At the same time, we would like to inculcate some pragmatism and make students recognise that implementing any technological solution requires grappling with tradeoffs.
Professional work ethic
We want our students to work with integrity and become accustomed to professional norms. This includes adopting professional standards for documentation and version control, becoming used to working in teams and navigating the challenges that come with shared ownership of responsibilities, and being cognisant of licensing terms and adhering to them.
Critical outlook towards technology
Students should be aware of the limitations of technological tools and have the ability to question
​
“
established” wisdom and resist polemical arguments (which are quite common in the technology space). An appreciation of the limits and limitations of machines should put in perspective the value of human thought and intelligence about what machines can deliver.
Reflective practice and self-directed learning
The ability to learn new tools is a professional necessity in the technology space. The curriculum will nudge students to become more aware of how they learn and will require them to learn new tools with limited guidance from faculty.
We also want students to view technological solutions as human creations (even if they are constructed using software tools) and want them to be aware of their design aesthetic and notions of elegance. In particular, we want students to gain a sensibility for when a
​
“
hack” or a
​
“
quick” solution is sufficient and when a more reasoned and elegant approach is warranted.
Effective communication
Students should be able to communicate technical ideas in various forms to both expert and lay audiences. Explaining how digital technologies work without resorting to jargon will not be treated as secondary to the ability to implement the technology.

prepare students to think critically and become active, self-directed learners.
students engage with the challenging social realities in India and apply this understanding across geographies.
Components of the four-year Undergraduate programme
Our four-year bachelor’s degree programme allows the opportunity to experience the full range of holistic and multidisciplinary liberal education in addition to a focus on chosen Major and Minor.
We also want to provide the learner with a flexible curricular structure that will enable creative combinations of disciplines for study, thereby creating new avenues for both work opportunities and higher education pathways.
Common Curriculum
The Common Curriculum will introduce students to the study of the themes and areas that emphasise and build critical and analytical abilities, and sensibilities for dialogue, reflection and cooperative learning. The Common Curriculum has three sub-components organised as below:
Foundations:
Build capacity for critical thinking, reasoning and communication.
Understanding India:
India’s history, society and possible future.
Creative Expressions:
Explore music, visual art, theatre, dance, martial arts, yoga, pottery, sport, and other creative areas.
Disciplinary Major
Will help build deep disciplinary understanding, and at the same time help the student to explore integrative thinking. Students will choose majors of study from a variety of disciplinary subjects on offer.
The courses in a Major are divided into required Core Courses and Electives. Core Courses will include introductory, intermediate, and advanced courses specific to the discipline. Elective courses will include courses from the disciplinary major or related disciplines that enhance the understanding of the student.
Students who are considering higher education pathways have the option to do a year-long independent research project in their fourth year of study.
Occupational Minor
Students must be prepared for the world of work at the end of the programme should they choose to enter it. We aim to provide the required skills and competencies for this through a Minor featuring courses in an
Occupational or Interdisciplinary theme.
These sets of courses are aimed to provide both conceptual understanding and skills and tools that will allow students to contribute through work and further study.
Students can opt for a minor in any one of the indicative areas listed below:
Climate Studies
Tech for Social Good
Biodiversity Conservation
Education | Music Education
Media and Journalism
Data, Democracy and Development
Sports and Fitness
— and more.
The selection of these indicative areas is based on the availability of courses and our evaluation of the student’s interests and academic needs. For each cohort, a final list of available courses will be announced at the end of their second semester.
Through courses in the
Occupational Minor
, we aim to help students understand and engage with current Indian and global social, political and cultural, and ecological conditions and also build the capacities to readily enter the workforce.
Flexible Courses
Students can craft their own educational experience by selecting courses in the following ways:
Take additional courses within their Disciplinary Major.
Pursue a Disciplinary Minor outside of their Major (For e.g. Economics Major and Philosophy as a Minor).
Interdisciplinary Minor that will enable them for their further higher studies or career pathways.
These courses could also be selected to enhance and broaden their
language skills and quantitative reasoning capacities/​programming skills.

Biography
Before joining the University, Rema Krishnaswamy worked at the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (
JNCASR
), Bangalore and at the Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore as a
DST
Ramanujan Fellow (2010−2015).
She obtained her PhD (2004) in physics from Raman Research Institute (
RRI
), Bangalore in the area of experimental soft condensed matter physics.
She was also a postdoctoral fellow at the Laboratoire de Physique des Solides, Universite Paris-Sud, Orsay (2004−2005) and subsequently a centenary postdoctoral fellow at Department of Physics, IISc (2006−2009).
Her research interests are interdisciplinary and deal with understanding the structure, phase behaviour, and non-equilibrium phenomena under flow of different
​
“
Soft Matter
” systems such as colloids, surfactants, emulsions, liquid crystals and bio-inspired materials.
Her current research interest is in the area of active matter that exhibit rich physics such as internally generated flows, self-motility, and large-scale collective motion, mimicking the behaviour observed in biological systems.
Active emulsions formed by micron-sized liquid crystal or oil drops that self-propel in an aqueous medium is a model system that is of interest to her.
Using optical techniques like microscopy and light scattering in the lab, she studies their dynamics, shape deformation, and collective behavior in the bulk and at fluid interfaces.

Biography
Science has excited me since childhood and continues to keep me captivated by its wonders. I have majored in chemistry; nevertheless, cherish physics, mathematics and their interfaces with chemistry. Even as a teacher, I remain a student of science and its lessons on nature. During my PhD I worked on experimental and theoretical aspects of actinide complexation; evaluating specific extractants for nuclear fuel processing. I carried out my research at Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (
IGCAR
) under the Department of Atomic Energy. Nuclear energy has emerged as one of the important alternatives to fossil fuels. Research on nuclear power has a vital role towards self-reliant and sustainable energy production. My post doctoral research (at Indian Institute of Science) involved computational studies on
2D
materials and heterostructures. I continue to be interested in computational research and especially relating these to experimental findings.
Young people are enthusiastic, unconditioned and untouched by several biases. Interacting with young minds and teaching science is my favourite occupation. In my spare time I enjoy practicing music, travelling often and reading both fiction and non-fiction.

Soft Matter
This course emphasizes the quantitative approach of physics and mathematics applied to everyday materials.
Facilitator
Rema Krishnaswamy
‘
Soft Matter’ was a term introduced by the French Physicist Pierre de Gennes in his Nobel lecture in 1991 to describe a large class of materials that exhibit large deformation under modest forces. The range of materials that fall under soft matter consists of polymers, liquid crystals, colloids, emulsions, foams, pastes, and complex fluids formed by mixtures of water with surfactants or amphiphiles, ferrofluids, granular materials, the vast array of biological or biologically inspired materials, the new area of active fluids, and much more.
This course emphasises a quantitative approach of physics and mathematics applied to everyday materials and provides an overview of an experiential learning of the subject through hands on projects, labs and student seminars.
We introduce you to Molecular Forces, energies, time scales and their interdependence in the context of soft matter systems. Concrete applications of Thermal and Statistical physics such as Brownian motion, random walks, diffusion, effect of entropy, self-assembly, and phase transitions are developed with examples from polymers, surfactants, colloids and liquid crystals.
Concepts in continuum mechanics such as viscosity and viscoelasticity of rubber are presented in an elementary manner for polymers. Small angle light scattering and microscopy to determine the structure of colloidal crystals, measuring the Debye screening length while salting out milk, ionic conductivity measurements to probe self-assembly in surfactant systems, visualizing and tracking Brazil nut effect in granular media, tracking the dynamics of a sedimenting sphere in a viscoelastic liquid, measuring optical birefringence of liquid crystals, determining drag force in a shear thickening liquid are some of the experiments or projects done by the students in this course.

Physics is an experimental science. Experiments in physics are performed to explore and understand the physical world or to test hypotheses derived from the knowledge acquired by these explorations. This standalone experimental course builds in the students the necessary skills to execute experiments. The essential skills to successfully perform an experiment are:
the design of the experiment
the selection and assembly of apparatus
data collection
data analysis and
the presentation of results.
Students develop these skills when doing experiments that complement content learning in various subjects such as Mechanics, Wave Motion, etc. This course aims to aid the maturation of these skills. Students will perform experiments that integrate various subjects in physics, such as using optical methods to measure mechanical strain. The course develops proficiency in the use of various measurement tools, from mechanical to electronic, to different levels of sophistication determined by the precision and accuracy desired for the experiment. Emphasis is also given to basic experimental skills such as choice of apparatus/​components, calibration and troubleshooting common failures.

Exploring a periscope made with prisms
This is a periscope made by students with two right angled prisms in a course on Optics taught by Physics faculty, Rema Krishnaswamy.
(These kind of setups are often used in optics research to manipulate or displace a beam of light. Also look up
​
‘
Dove prism’)
What phenomena/​concepts is this setup based on? We wish to pose some questions/​ideas for us to explore various Physics aspects related to this setup.
(The students have used chalk dust from a duster to make the path of the laser light more clearly visible)

What other ideas in Physics could we think of while exploring this setup?
What if the refractive index of glass was not 1.5?
Will this setup of two right angled prisms work as a periscope for any medium other than glass? If we had hollow right angled prisms and we filled them with water, will this still work?
What happens if we immerse the setup in a water tank?
Does the periscope still work?
What refractive index should the material of the right angled prisms have to make a periscope in water?
What should be the refractive index of the liquid so that these right angled glass prisms would still work as a periscope?
Could you still try to make it work in water?
You could try to change the orientations of the prism. This may not work perfectly; could you still try to make the rays travel like the ones in the photo, as far as possible? Why did this arrangement work?
What else did you observe in this experiment?
What if you had three right angled prisms? Will it be possible to make the incoming and outgoing rays to better resemble the ones in air?
What if you had equilateral prisms? We could try these things with this type of prisms.
A hollow prism
Now let us take a hollow prism made of glass sheets (One way of doing this is to use microscope slides and a glass base and stick them with clear/​transparent araldite). We can fill this with water, repeat the experiments and observe what happens at the different interfaces for different conditions. Could you think about the different phenomena and concepts involved?

A suggested teaching sequence
&
activities on total internal reflection
Some safety instructions need to be given to students while handling lasers. Even though most lasers used in labs are low power lasers, if the light enters someone’s eyes, it can cause damage. Please make sure that stray laser light is not pointed at the level of people’s faces. Perhaps it is a good practice to keep the light in a horizontal plane near about the height of the table top.
Preferably students should be given the following instructions one after the other, as and when they finish a given task and writing about it. They could perhaps work in pairs.
Take a laser and a right angled prism. Make the beam fall on different faces of the prism. Can you try to make the beam fall on the prism such that we get to see total internal reflection? What else do you notice about the prisms and the laser beam?
https://​en​.wikipedia​.org/​w​i​k​i​/​T​o​t​a​l​_​i​n​t​e​r​n​a​l​_​r​e​f​l​e​ction
Now take two such right angled prisms and arrange them to make a periscope (although a real periscope is used vertically – like ones used in submarines, here we will set it up in a horizontal plane). Basically a light beam should emerge parallel to the incoming beam but shifted by a certain distance. This technique happens to be used in optics research labs. You can use chalk dust or something similar to make the path of the laser beam more easily visible.
Why did this setup work? Suppose the refractive index of glass was say, 1.2 instead of 1.5. Could we have made this kind of periscope with two right angled prisms then?
Now take the two prisms that make up your periscope and place them in a glass aquarium such that you can still see your periscope work like earlier.
setup placed in an aquarium
Now pour water in the aquarium. Does the periscope still work? Why do you see what you see? Please also reason quantitatively with specific number. the refractive index of water (with respect to vacuum/​air) is 1.33, while that of glass is 1.5
Now try to rearrange the prisms so that you still make it work almost like the periscope in air, i.e. the outgoing ray is almost parallel to the incoming ray. Please sketch your setup and measure the angles by which you had to tilt the two prisms.
Trying to make a periscope work in water
A hollow prism
We can use clear/​transparent araldite to stick together microscope slides to make a hollow equilateral prism as well as a hollow right angled prism. Of course, another glass plate will have to be stuck at the bottom. We can now fill different liquids in this prism a perform experiments on light with these fluids.
Reflection can give us polarised light (this property is often used in photography)

No lockdown for Physics during the
COVID-19
pandemic
While many institutions resorted to simulations to cope with online science education during the pandemic, the teachers at Azim Premji University tried to keep things real. One of them,
Richard Fernandes
, shares stories from behind the scenes with
Nandita Jayaraj.

Richard Fernandes in class
Pistons, cylinders, springs… not things I ever imagined lay beneath an innocent-looking hand sanitiser spray. And I may never have known had I not walked into the physics laboratory while Richard Fernandes caught up in discussion with some students about the working of this simple machine that has come to find a place in most backpacks and handbags today.
“
I’m an experimentalist at heart, so my approach to teaching physics is experiment-heavy,” said the veteran physicist and educator, as he settled down at one of the lab benches for a chat.
All of Richard’s undergraduate classes — whether theory or practicals — take place in the lab, and this hands-on approach seems to be a trademark of the physics programme at Azim Premji University, where Richard teaches.
The physics students at the University are encouraged to build their own equipment and set up their own experiments, rather than use ready-made ones that often serve as nothing more than a black box.
This is something Richard and many of the other teachers at the University believe will help students see and understand what lies inside, enabling them to go beyond the obsession with reproducing some numbers stated in the textbook.
​
“
Homemade equipment has a
​
‘
bareness’ to it,” he said,
​
“
and this bareness leads to a lot more learning and a connection to what you’re doing.”
Richard’s perspective fits in neatly with the ethos of the physics group, wherein the students are encouraged to think of their surroundings as a
​
‘
corridor’ to physics.
​
“
Essentially, we want them to connect the physics learnt in the classroom or textbook to physics in the universe around them.”
“
A lot of physics happened by observing common phenomena,” he said, bringing up the famous example of Galileo Galilei,
​
“
the man who started off physics as we know it.”
Galileo, pointed out Richard, discovered the laws of the pendulum after he observed the way a lantern suspended from a wire at his church swung back and forth.
​
“
He did not have a bob and a massless string… so even abstract laws are enunciated by observations made from very simple apparatus. Physics doesn’t come from equipment built in factories.”
What happens to this corridor to physics during the pandemic, when classrooms are sporadically forced to go online? For many schools and education platforms around the world, the answer to the dilemma of online science education came in the form of simulations, where various softwares are used to show students virtual simulations of experiments, supposedly giving them the opportunity to
​
“
gain practical knowledge” in the absence of lab infrastructure.
The jury is still out on whether simulations are an effective tool for science education, but according to Richard, it is a mistake to see them as a replacement for practical sessions.
“
I squirm when I think of forcing experiments to fit a theory. It’s unfair to the experiment… it downplays it to make it a visual manifestation on a screen. I feel that simulations can aid learning of theory, but it cannot take the place of experiments.”
So, when the time came to adapt to ever-extending lockdowns, Richard and the rest of the team of physicist-teachers at Azim Premji University chose instead to modify lab experiments into their bare bones, which would enable students to recreate those at their homes.
These new versions of experiments used items that could be easy to procure for most students — such as string, rubber bands, blades, etc. There were, of course, some apparatus required that may not be as easy to find. That’s where the kits came in.
Kits lined up, ready for packaging.

“
We sent them kits containing instruction sheets and things that may not be easily accessible to those in small towns… remember, those days shops were closed, too. We innovated, designed new experiments, and some of the experiments turned out to be quite sophisticated in terms of the results they achieved. That was the important discovery we made.”
Richard was heartened to see students enjoying building experiments at home with the help of their parents, siblings, and the occasional grandparent.
“
Some had to find a neighbour to borrow a carrom coin from… they used to send us back videos and we could see people helping them. This was nice because it brought a connection with physics to their own environment, a new dimension to learning,” he reminisced.
The actual experience of building these kits was no mean feat, but the teachers took the challenge head-on. Richard had a twinkle in his eye when he recollected the logistics involved.
“
Our homes became packing shops. Everything was laid out in an assembly line. We learned how to make the cardboard boxes, pack the stuff well, close it, put the stickers on and then go to the post office. Most of us are ready to work for Amazon now,” he joked.

At the post office, it was another adventure.
​
“
They told us electronic things weren’t allowed, so we had to fight with them, camouflage it to use other terms and clarify that these were just experiments for students. Once dispatched, we had to track the parcels on the app to ensure they were reaching the students. It was an interesting experience!”
So, are you ready for another lockdown, I asked him.
​
“
Oh yes, now we are experts as far as teaching and lockdowns are concerned.”

Biography
I am a science communicator, journalist, and author and I am currently a Communications Consultant at Azim Premji University.
After a BSc in Biotechnology and an MSc in Bioinformatics, I studied journalism at the Asian College of Journalism (
ACJ
), Chennai.
My first job was with The Hindu, a national newspaper based in Chennai. After two years of editing, writing and creating pages for the newspaper, I moved to Bengaluru to co-edit a monthly science magazine targeted at children.
In 2016, along with my friend and colleague Aashima Dogra, I co-founded the feminist science multimedia platform The​Life​of​Science​.com which covers the research and journeys of underrepresented groups in Indian science, and reports on issues of access and inequity that exist within the
STEM
community.
I am passionate about storytelling science and discovering novel methods to do so, especially using social media. Some of the memorable projects I have led are #365IndianWomenInSTEM (a Twitter-based campaign to highlight one woman in science working in India on each day of 2021), a mini-series on mental health in Indian science.
I am also very fortunate to have edited a special series of comics featuring transgender persons in Indian science in collaboration with several artists and writer Sayantan Datta.
My work has been published on platforms such as The Wire, Firstpost, ThePrint, Mongabay-India and Caravan.
I have along the way authored a few children’s books, the latest being
Rathna and the Ring of Fire
(published by Pratham Books),
31 Fantastic Adventures in Science
(co-authored by Aashima Dogra and published by Penguin Books), and
Anna’s Extraordinary Experiments with Weather
(published by Pratham Books).
I love bird watching, trying out different kinds of food and I have a burgeoning interest in natural building.

From Hoskote to Hawaii: The intriguing world of large telescopes
Having been around telescopes for most of his life,
Proteep Mallik
muses on the promises and perils of the Thirty Metre Telescope (
TMT
), and what it means for a country like India.
Just about 30 kilometres from the
University campus
, in Hoskote taluk in Karnataka, lies the India-TMT Optics Fabrication Facility (
ITOFF
). The typical modern office building façade hides the fact that inside, cutting-edge machines are precisely polishing and preparing about 84 mirror segments to be shipped to Hawaii, where they will be assembled into one of the world’s largest telescopes.
The Thirty Metre Telescope (
TMT
) is an international mega project that, once completed, could tell us about
supermassive black holes, the early universe, planets outside our solar system and the possibility of life in them
. Along the way, the
TMT
project has unwittingly revived the age-old conflict of
​
‘
whose science is this anyway?’
The earliest telescopes
The
​
‘
Thirty’ in
TMT
refers to the diameter of the primary lens or mirror inside a telescope. The bigger this number, the more light the telescope can collect and the further out in space we can see. And humans have come a long way in our engineering of telescopes.
Galileo, considered to be the first to point a telescope towards the sky, used a lens that was just a few centimetres in size. This was in 1609. Even with such a small lens size, Galileo was able to see the four largest moons of Jupiter.
​
“
That was really revolutionary for the time,” pointed out
Proteep Mallik
, who teaches physics at Azim Premji University and specialises in telescope optics.
Over the next few decades, the lens inside telescopes got bigger, and we could see more and more of the solar system. The trouble was, lenses get really thick as they expand in diameter, so telescopes with large lenses were too heavy to maneuver.
Newton is credited with the breakthrough of using mirrors instead of lenses, and this allowed telescopes to see better whilst staying relatively compact. By 1781, William Herschel had built a 6‑inch telescope which he used to discover Uranus, the first planet to be discovered by a telescope.
Herschel would go on to construct a 1.2‑metre telescope that would remain the largest telescope in the world for 50 years. Despite being terribly unwieldy, it is said to have been used to discover Enceladus and Mimas, the 6
th
and 7
th
moons of Saturn.
Building a culture of astronomy using a telescope
It was a matter of great joy for Proteep and his students when the University agreed to fund the purchase of an 8‑inch telescope. Ever since, the astronomy enthusiasts on campus have gotten together for periodic stargazing nights.
“
We also designed an
astronomy elective course
, and that’s how over the last 6 – 7 years, we’ve built up a culture of astronomy here,” said Proteep, who himself had benefited profoundly from such a culture. Both his parents were astronomers, and so dinner table conversations tended to revolve around scientific discoveries, newly published papers, the latest images from the Hubble Space Telescope, etc.
Moreover, he began accompanying his mother to the 1‑metre telescope at the Vainu Bappu Observatory in Kavalur, Tamil Nadu. This observatory would soon have a 2.3‑metre telescope as well. Proteep went on to study physics and specialised in optics.
He worked with technologies related to telescopes and telescope building — for example, figuring out the precise shape of optical mirrors that needed to be used.
​
“
A lot of those technologies are what is enabling the building of a lot of these fancy, expensive, new large, ground-based and space-based telescopes today,” he said.
A new generation of large telescopes
For decades, Proteep has enthusiastically tracked the rapid evolution of telescopes— first as a curious youngster, then as an optical engineer, researcher, and finally as a physics teacher. One of the breakthroughs that excited him the most came from Roger Angel, an astronomer at the University of Arizona who Proteep worked with during his graduate studies.
“
In the 1970s and 80s people had started trying to build very large mirrors which were also light,” he explained. This wasn’t easy, because though mirrors may be more compact than lenses, a thin single massive mirror is highly prone to bending and breaking. Scientists had to come up with a more practical way to build telescopes large enough to see distant secrets of the universe.
Angel, inspired by the architecture of a beehive, came up with an innovation that would kick off a new generation of large telescopes.
​
“
You have these hexagonal honeycomb structures that make the hive very sturdy and stable. So why not try and do something like that with large mirrors?” asked Proteep. Eventually, Angel would figure out that hexagonal support structures could be used to build 8.4‑metre diameter mirrors that are relatively light.

If you’re wondering how a telescope can look back in time, it’s because light, though very fast travelling, takes time to reach us — especially if we are looking at something that’s very far away. So, the further away we can see, the deeper into the past we are looking at.
Looking far and back in time
According to Proteep, there are two major motivations for larger telescopes.
​
“
One is to look into the very distant universe and see if we can get close to the time of the origin of the universe and see what the universe looked like, then,” he said.
If you’re wondering how a telescope can look back in time, it’s because light, though very fast travelling, takes time to reach us — especially if we are looking at something that’s very far away. So, the further away we can see, the deeper into the past we are looking at.
Secondly, said Proteep,
​
“
there are also questions about the current universe — is there life on other planets, other than in our own solar system?” Space telescopes can answer these questions too, and they have the giant advantage of being outside the Earth’s messy atmosphere.
​
“
It’s a boon to all living life on the Earth, but for astronomers, it’s a terrible thing… astronomers would love the Earth’s atmosphere to just go away,” joked Proteep.
However, space telescopes suffer the limitation of being far more expensive than ground telescopes. The 6.5‑metre James Webb Space Telescope cost over 5 times as much as the 30-metre
TMT
is estimated to cost.
Currently, the largest functional telescopes are about 10 metres in size; the 10-metre Keck telescope is what astrophysicist Andrea Ghez used to prove the existence of a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. Thanks to the lightweight mirror technology, there are more and much larger telescopes underway. One of them is the Giant Magellan Telescope (
GMT
), which at 25 metres is slated to be the largest optical telescope on Earth when it becomes operational in 2029. With a diameter of 30 metres, the
TMT
will be larger, but it has a long way to go.
The
TMT
is proposed to be built on the historical Mauna Kea mountain in Hawaii. Close to 14,000 feet tall, yet relatively accessible, this mountain is a dream destination for astronomers.
​
“
It’s surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, which is this lovely thermal sink,” said Proteep.
“
The temperature over the Pacific Ocean creates a kind of equilibrium, such that you don’t have a lot of atmospheric turbulence which would have caused blurry images of stars and galaxies
. It’s really one of the best sites on the planet to do astronomy. You’re far away from the sloppiness of the atmosphere, that you can even imagine doing infrared astronomy, other kinds of astronomy that you couldn’t possibly do at lower elevations. It’s almost like space astronomy!”

But way before Western astronomers got attached to this mountain, it was already being revered by the native people of Hawaii who believe that many of their spirits and deities reside on the mountain. For years, Hawaiians have resisted the loss of their rights over this land.
Scarred by science?
As of now, 11 countries have already built 13 astronomical observatories on Mauna Kea since 1964.
​
“
If you look at a picture of this mountain, it’s not smooth as other mountains are,” pointed out Proteep.
​
“
You see these buildings and domes. So I can imagine, a native person looking at that mountain would find it completely scarred… scarred by science.”
Conflicts such as these are not new to science, and neither is it to Proteep.
​
“
Even as a kid visiting the Kavalur observatory with my mother, I remember thinking about the fact that here is this internationally-trained group of scientists from the city of Bengaluru, coming to this tiny village and essentially taking over 100 acres of forest to do their science.
We need to think very carefully about how an institution situates itself within the local community
. We need the support of the local community to do this kind of work.”
Years later, Proteep would find himself at the Kitt Peak Observatory on a mountain in Arizona, that is part of the Native American Tohono O’odham Nation.
​
“
The observatory has done a reasonably good job of astronomy outreach with the Tohono O’odham people. They also train and hire a lot of Native American people,” he added.
With the Indian government recently approving
INR
2,600 crore gravitational wave detection facility to come up on 174 acres of land in Hingoli, Maharashtra, Indian scientists too will have to grapple with similar issues.
Just like the native communities around Mauna Kea and Kitt Peak, the people of Hingoli district too may question if outreach, training and job opportunities will make up for what they stand to lose to make way for the LIGO-India project.

A precedent for future big science projects
What do these conflicts mean for
TMT
? When can we expect it to achieve
​
‘
first light’? Proteep recalls discussing the project with his colleagues way back in 2014, when it was expected that the telescope would become operational in 2022.
​
“
That was eight years ago,” he shrugged.
“
If you go to their website now, the timeline says 2027 is when
TMT
will achieve first light. But given how complex the whole instrument is, and the number of people involved, the pandemic, and so on, I doubt the 2027 deadline will be met. My guess is that we could see it operational over the next eight or 10 years.”
Proteep’s estimation definitely seems more realistic, considering that we are still not cent percent certain that Mauna Kea will be the site of the
TMT
. The island of La Palma in Spain’s Canary Islands was declared as an alternative destination for the telescope in light of the fierce protests in Hawaii. However, in March of 2023, there was a development indicating that a compromise may work out at Mauna Kea after all.
Several existing telescopes may be decommissioned to reduce the burden on the mountain. It was announced that from 2028, a new oversight board would take over the management of the site from the University of Hawaii. This board would include both astronomers as well as representatives from Native Hawaiian communities. Many see this as a
new and inclusive approach
that could set a precedent for future big science projects.
Last year, as part of the University’s
Understanding India course
, Proteep took his students to the
ITOFF
facility.
​
“
I wanted my students to grapple with the ideas of what it means for India to spend
USD
200 million of taxpayer money on this extremely large and complex project,” he said.

What it means for India to contribute to the
TMT
project
The immediate advantage for India to be involved in the
TMT
project is the
access to the telescope it offers our astronomers
.
​
“
It’s very hard to get telescope time. There are thousands of astronomers sending proposals, fighting over the limited telescope time available. Most astronomers come away disappointed,” Proteep informed. Being a 10 percent partner in
TMT
, India will get about 36 nights of access every year. That’s a lot of telescope time.
As they marvelled at the sight of the mirror segments waiting to be polished to perfection, Proteep pointed out to the students that telescope time wasn’t the only thing India gains by contributing to this project. While the mirror segments will eventually go to Hawaii,
the expensive polishing machines made from proprietary technology
will stay behind.
​
“
We will, hopefully, be able to use these machines to make our own 8 or 10-metre telescope. And Indian scientists will have all 365 days of the year to use that one.”
So were his students sufficiently convinced about
TMT
?
​
“
I think many students were impressed that scientists and engineers are doing something as complex, right here in our backyard! These capabilities will go into building many other things besides the telescope eventually,” he said.
However, neither students nor professors are fooling themselves about the issues that do exist in spite of all the positives.
​
“
Our students are very critical, you know,” he laughed.
​
“
I don’t think anyone, myself included, would be fully convinced of any one of these projects. But ultimately, many of us justify these projects saying it is for the greater good of scientific discovery, and this indomitable spirit that humans have…”
“
I think many students were impressed that scientists and engineers are doing something as complex, right here in our backyard! These capabilities will go into building many other things besides the telescope eventually.”

Astronomy
Using physics to explain observations at cosmic scales. It’s truly out of this world!
Facilitator
Proteep Mallik
Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences and also one of the youngest sciences. Today it is a field at the forefront with exciting discoveries like planets around other stars. There are new ideas like dark energy and black holes. We have large, ambitious, and complex international projects like the Laser Interferometric Gravitational wave observatory (
LIGO
) and Square Kilometer Array (
SKA
) which keep appearing in the headlines, and in which India too has a share. These use all wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, and other messengers like cosmic rays, neutrinos, and gravitational waves. An introductory astronomy course at the undergraduate level brings several areas of physics together in with exciting applications, keeping the principles accessible. One starts with things students are familiar with but also curious about like planets, stars and galaxies, and this is taken right up to current developments. Astronomy is largely an observational science and this course will emphasize how we know as much as what we know. The treatment is quantitative but not detailed, so what is really needed is sound grasp of twelfth standard physics and mathematics and willingness to recollect use, and add to these.

Courses at Azim Premji University
Team History and the Multiverse Called India
Neha Wadhwa
discovers the Understanding India courses with
Sharmadip Basu.
The History team at Azim Premji University helps students to articulate latent ideas about what their India looks like.
What is India? How often have you thought about India as an entity in the last few years? How does one start to understand the contemporary situation of the nation we inhabit? Can we begin by looking at the struggle for independence? Could one start by looking at the prominent empires that ruled the subcontinent? Or should one be looking at the trajectory of past civilisations?
What did the previous versions of climate change look like? Or maybe one could start from understanding continental drift! Where does the idea of India-as-we-know-it really begin?
This is where the History faculty at the School of Arts and Sciences steps in and helps students think through such complicated questions in their first year at Azim Premji University. Making for an admittedly intense start, it helps students articulate latent ideas about what their India looks like.
The Understanding India courses at Azim Premji University
The History team helps students locate the nation within a deep context and imagine the possibilities for equitable social actions. Two courses are offered to this end, the first of these is called
​
‘
Understanding India I: Many Pasts of India’s Present
’, offered in the first semester. This is followed by,
​
‘
Understanding India
II
: India’s Present and its Possible Futures
’ in the second semester.

Sharmadip Basu, who has been involved with the conception and teaching of the Understanding India courses, explained that these courses are very different from typical undergraduate programmes in History. The
Understanding India courses
are a part of the
Common Curriculum
offered to all undergraduate students at the
School of Arts and Sciences
.
In these courses, the faculty’s approach is to initiate conversations based on students’ lived experiences, expand their knowledge by presenting relevant historical facts, act as moderators for the ensuing debates, create space for alternate viewpoints, understand resistances and lastly, help expand students’ social imaginations for future actions.
The faculty guide the students in developing a critical gaze that lets them develop an understanding of structural inequalities brought out by caste, religion and gender norms. This is coupled with a commitment to the study of actions taken by people to help themselves and others.
Sharmadip shared his hope that moving beyond the recognition of social injustice, and towards acknowledging the history of empathetic, affirmative action would let the students develop an optimistic outlook about the potential their lives hold.
On my part, I found myself wondering if my experience of India would have been different if my early life had included more conversations about social movements and resistance. During our conversation, I realised that these efforts inside and outside the classrooms represent not only the core values of the Understanding India courses and the Common Curriculum but also of the University.
Experiential learning: Understanding India courses do not subscribe to exams as evaluative tools
Subscribing to the virtues of experiential learning, the students are tasked with group
projects
and assignments. Like most courses at Azim Premji University, the Understanding India courses too do not subscribe to exams as evaluative tools.
Instead, students are marked on the projects like the
​
‘
Neighbourhood Observation Project’, where in their first semester they explore Sarjapur and Yamare villages on the outskirts of Bengaluru where the University is set.
In their second semester, students undertake the
​
‘
Bangalore City Project’, where they study the various aspects of urban infrastructure. Besides these, there are many other activities and smaller assignments which help students build a comprehensive and eclectic understanding of India.
Images by previous batches of first year undergraduate students of the School of Arts and Sciences, clicked during their field projects.
Departure from common ways of teaching History
Sharmadip highlights the
​
‘
presentist’ perspective adhered to in the Understanding India classes. He asserts that it is quite a departure from the typical way History courses are commonly taught.
Instead of being told stories of the past, unanchored in time, the students are encouraged to reflect on the
​
‘
whats’, the
​
‘
whys’ and the
​
‘
hows’ of their present, of their familial resources, their social locations, their life chances and lived experiences.
This way, students learn to identify the circulating social inequalities in their lives. To make his point, he quietly offered the rhetoric,
​
“
What is the point of studying History, if not to understand the present?”

Design concerns itself with envisioning, planning and creating objects, spaces or interactive systems to address a need or a problem. It attempts to meet the needs of a variety of users with responses that are aligned with their specific contexts. It aims to understand situations and create holistic, appropriate solutions.
While design is a large discipline with many domains, this Occupational Track will look at the design of products, the practical use of technology in various enterprises and the design of spaces for accessibility and interaction. It includes the process of ideating, developing and refining products that meet specific market needs, and addresses problems faced by users. Examples of this could include making a system which could
​
‘
intelligently’ water a crop based on environmental factors — the intelligence coming from a microcontroller getting its inputs from various sensors; designing an outdoor seating space based on the needs of the people using them; designing and
3D
printing a customized gear unit.
Design is often looked at as
​
“
making things look pretty”. The functional aspects come first while engaging with design — i.e. the object should be able to fulfil the intended use for which it was designed for. However, in the process of arriving at a design, aspects such as the use of appropriate materials, supporting the interaction between users and delightful elements that allow a user to create an emotional connect are as important as the usability of the product. The aesthetics of an object would make it more acceptable for people to use it — hence it cannot be ignored.
In the Indian context it becomes imperative to consider design in real and local contexts; to leverage the tools, techniques, mediums and processes to look for low-resource solutions in various contexts. Many issues that face us are what are known as
​
‘
wicked’ problems (for example, access to clean water, adequate nutrition for children or segregating plastics for recycling) — with interdependent factors that seem impossible to solve. Engaging with these requires a design process which is iterative and works by making incremental changes in a collaborative manner with collective inputs needing expertise from different fields. This is something we hope this
OT
will expose students to.
Given the social commitment and orientation of the Foundation and the University, design seems like a natural fit to equip our students to engage in a wide range of relevant fields from working with artisan communities on enhancing livelihoods to developing products and technology to improve aspects of people’s lives.

The final course in the
OT
would encourage students to synthesise and apply their learnings from the earlier courses in a more focussed manner. Students will work over the semester on an idea or concept that varies each year, looking for insights which could lead to interventions, building prototypes using their previous learning and skills. For example, if the brief for a given batch is working on improving access to an area for differently abled people, students would get the chance to identify and work on a few issues in this specific area.

This course is an introduction to the methods, ideas and techniques involved in the design process which are relevant to the Design for Communities
OT
. It also serves as an introduction to studio-based work and ways of communicating and sharing ideas and learnings with others. Students will begin to observe how spaces and objects are used and how their form and structure influences how they are used. This will be done through a series of short immersions, which will involve observing people and spaces around campus; they will document and present their observations, and work towards finding insights. They will also begin to look at the choices that are involved in coming up with the design of an object — their implications for the people who use them, their sustainability and how easy it is for people to procure them.
The course will also introduce some of the issues that come up in later courses — materials, structures and interactions.

In this course, students would develop competency in ways of designing and making simple mechanical and digital devices. This would involve using ideas such as feedback loops and conditional responses. While we would like students to appreciate the skill and sophistication of a purely mechanical system such as the
​
‘
governor’ in James Watt’s steam engine, this course will equip them to build quick prototypes with sensors, microcontrollers, circuits and programming code. Students would learn about data-logging and putting up live information on a web page. This would find application in diverse situations ranging from citizen science to agriculture.

Starting with simple machines and going through automata, motion using electromagnetism and digital movement, students will continue building on the tactile understanding of
​
‘
stuff’ from the previous course. The approach in this course will be based on the use of contemporary materials, processes and tools — hence they will not necessarily look at the history of these things unless they impact their current use.
Since this course will be offered on campus in summer, we conceptualise it as a space to get students to appreciate and learn about working in a studio environment at a longer stretch which is otherwise difficult within the semester. It will also provide an opportunity for students to visit and learn about the work of design studios and practitioners in and around the city.

The course aims to provide competency into understanding and selecting the right kind of materials for making specific objects or spaces. Students will learn to look at materials from points of view of access, reuse, and the ways in which they can be worked on. Students will learn to discern affordances that different media such as wood, plastic, metal, bamboo offer in terms of their manipulability, form making and their other structural characteristics. They will also begin to learn the use of tools — hand, power and computer controlled. The last would require them to learn the basics of 3
d
modelling using appropriate software.
While the course will largely focus on these materials, we will have space in the course to also use materials that have contemporary relevance such as lantana, banana fibre, water hyacinth, etc. which may change from year to year. This will depend on the availability of having visiting craftspeople/​designers with experience in working these materials.

Climate change is transforming human society and the natural world at an extraordinary scale and pace. Humans are, however, not alone on this planet but are bound with other species in an intricate web of life with this fact often being ignored. Species respond to its changing environment differently, and their interactions with the physical world and the organisms around it trigger a cascade of responses through the entire ecosystem. Hence, though climate change happens on a global scale, the ecological impacts are often manifested at a local scale and vary from place to place and species to species. Thus, it becomes pivotal to understand how human actions may endanger their own wellbeing, as well as change the fate of other species. This course will entail learning how climate change has switched on the trail of consequences that has disrupted the balance of natural ecosystems impacting the survival and reproduction of many other species which has eventually led to the detriment of human wellbeing. Through several case studies spanning India and abroad students will understand the ecosystem level impacts of climate change.

Students have not studied the relationship of the climate crisis to human development, economic systems and climate solutions. This course uses two frameworks to discuss these aspects of the climate crisis.
The first is a societal and climate justice frame to understand the origins of the climate crisis in the history of human development. Students have seen the climate crisis as an emissions problem but have not examined the deep structural causes related to inequity that underly the crisis. By examining the economic system that undergirds human endeavour this course seeks to inquire into the nature of industrialism and whether there exist alternatives to the current system. India’s economic growth in the next 40 years will be examined to see what pathways of development can be imagined for our country.
The second frame is a personal one in which students will be asked to determine their relationship to the climate crisis. By examining their fears and motivations students can realize their own blocks to action and how they can create solutions to the climate crisis. Students will be assisted in this by studying examples of collective action from around the world. Ultimately the course seeks to create links between these two frames, the societal and personal, such that students see themselves as part of a larger whole with possibilities of creating networks of action.

We envision the field practice to be run as a series of workshops. Students will learn practical skills such as energy and water audits, GIS-remote sensing, biodiversity assessments, making environmental sensors and apply them to specific problems. Workshops will be accompanied by short (1−2 day) field trips to organisations involved in these areas.

Biography
Kaustubh is a biomedical engineer who veered into Biology during his PhD days. He is deeply interested in understanding people’s relationship with nature and their response to the climate crisis.
Prior to joining Azim Premji University, he worked as a teacher in Rishi Valley School, Andhra Pradesh. There he was involved in developing an activity-based curriculum for science teaching in the middle and senior school.  He was also part of the Young Investigator Programme at the National Centre for Biological Sciences.  His post-doctoral training is from the University of California, Irvine and doctorate is from University of Florida.
With other faculty members in the Biology group of the university he has co-authored a free online introductory biology textbook called I Think Biology (
https://​ithinkbi​ol​o​gy​.in/
). This unique textbook utilises a case-study-based approach with examples from India, that is accessible, self-contained, and prioritises essential capacities over content. He is also the project lead on Tanks of Anekal (
https://​tankso​fanekal​.in/
), a documentation effort to make data about Anekal’s water bodies open and accessible to all.

This course, the second in a two-part series on the scientific foundations of climate science begins with a discussion on the evidence of past and present climate change. While the first introductory course focuses on the fundamental physical processes that shape climate and the anthropogenic perturbations to these processes, this course examines the global consequences of these perturbations and looks at the outlook of planning for risks in the face of an uncertain future.

The course will introduce students to the science behind climate and climate change. We will use elementary concepts from physics to build conceptual models of the earth’s climate. By using a first principles approach, this course will serve as an entry point to understanding the earth’s climate system for students of all disciplines, Sciences and Humanities alike. Using experiments, measurements, data collection activities and computer demonstrations/​animations as active pedagogic tools, students will gain a practical view of the earth’s climate systems. We also aim to give the students a taste of climate modelling, by using simple examples that can be analysed using models of feedback.

The Technology for Social Good occupational track has been designed based on the Azim Premji Foundation’s extensive experience in working with social sector organizations. Many of these organizations are addressing long-standing social problems through utmost dedication and a strong desire to improve the society we live in. There is a lot of scope for facilitating the work of these organizations through the use of digital technology. While accomplishing social change is a slow process requiring long-term engagement, digital technology can assist these organizations in making their operations more effective and by permitting better utilization of scarce resources. At present, these organizations are often limited by the availability of people who are sensitive to the context in which the organization operates while also being capable of implementing and customizing technology solutions.

Students will get an opportunity to engage with various social sector organizations over a period of five weeks. Through these engagements, students will recognize the different ways in
which these organizations use digital technology and the challenges they encounter. In the previous two courses, students would have been engaging with technology with a broad canvas. This course will orient students towards the specific needs of social sector organizations. This shift in perspective will be needed for the final two courses.

This course will introduce no-code/low-code frameworks for developing web and mobile applications for typical social sector scenarios. These frameworks make the development of applications more accessible. Students would be able to devote more time figuring out what to develop instead of grappling with how to develop the application (as would be the case in a conventional programming environment).

The final course in the occupational track will bring together themes from all the previous courses. This course has two complementary aspects. First, students will be able to demonstrate their skills by working on a significant project. Second, it will prepare students for work in social sector organizations by providing exposure to current opportunities and challenges. Through interactions with practitioners, students would be able to develop a sense for the nature of work they will encounter either in their internship or employment after graduation. Students will also be introduced to some emerging technology tools that appear promising.

During the internship, students will apply and refine the skills they learnt in the occupational track. The internship will also help them develop a more nuanced perspective on technology use and deployment in the social sector. Students are likely to work closely with their mentor organization in developing or customizing software applications. Some students may also help design and conduct training exercises for employees/​stakeholders in the use of technology. We anticipate that students will carry out their internships in organizations that the Azim Premji Foundation already has a relationship with. We would also try to prioritize organizations based out of Bengaluru so that students can continue to stay on campus.

Biography
S Kumar Mallavarapu is a physicist with a PhD in theoretical physics from Washington University in St. Louis,
USA
, who has made a significant contribution to research about the study of dense quark matter and cold atom systems. In this regard, several aspects of quark superfluidity in the two-fluid formalism were derived from an underlying field-theoretic model. Another important discovery was that the first (second) sound evolves from a density (temperature) wave at low temperatures to a temperature (density) wave at high temperatures.
Furthermore, Kumar created a lattice simulation confirming the decay of a superfluid vortex (in the colour-flavour-locked phase of quark matter) into semi-superfluid vortices. Additionally, he has studied issues related to population trapping in periodically driven Rydberg atoms. In this context, he has published on the analogue of the Kapitza’s pendulum problem at the quantum level. Problems related to the application of field theory and quantum mechanics appeal to him.
As part of his academic career, he has taught undergraduate courses such as wave mechanics, quantum mechanics, electricity and magnetism, optics, and mathematical methods. He has also taught postgraduate physics courses on electromagnetic theory, nuclear and particle physics, and mathematical physics. He has also taught a programming-based course on statistical inference in data science.

The students will be exposed to a range of ideas about the aims of education, and the multifaceted role of schools and teachers in today’s world. In examining some key factors — historical, sociological, and political— that underlie the emergence of a stratified school system in contemporary India, they will become more conscious of diverse educational goals of school-goers in our country and develop greater sensitivity towards issues of social justice. Students will engage with the nature of knowledge, and ideas of the school curriculum, as well as issues around languages of instruction, considering their cognitive and ethical implications. They will also gain a nuanced appreciation of the activities of teaching and learning, and the multiple possibilities inherent in teacher-student interactions within school settings. Through this course, they will have opportunities to revisit their own beliefs and will begin formulating their own vision for education and teaching.

Biography
Krishna works with the Teacher Education programme and has a keen interest in schools as centres for learning in modern democratic societies. He is particularly focused on understanding the necessary conditions for good learning atmospheres and the essential qualities of good teachers.
Before joining the University, he spent over 17 years working in various teaching and administrative roles at two different Krishnamurti-inspired schools. He taught subjects like Psychology, General Studies, and theatre to senior secondary school students, as well as teaching English, social sciences, and woodcarving to middle and high school students. Additionally, he was part of the governing council of one of the schools, contributing to its educational, philosophical, and financial aspects.
Krishna’s decision to become a teacher stemmed from his earlier experience in individual and group work at a residential therapeutic community for adults with severe psychological disorders and with children on the Autistic Spectrum at a day-care centre.
He has an educational background in Psychology and Cultural Studies.

Language is interwoven with human experience, cognition, emotions, and identity. It has been an intriguing area of study for long with fascinating insights on its role in human development. In schools, it mediates teaching and learning in all its forms.
Therefore, this course will focus on making you critically aware of the role language plays in education. It will explore how language development is a fundamental process of
​
‘
meaning-making’ for human beings.
It will look at multilingualism in India and examine how different home and school languages have an impact on children’s learning.
Further, in this course, you will discover ways in which you as teacher-students can hold a discussion and dialogue, ask questions, give explanations, and use language to help children engage in classrooms.

This course will enable student-teachers to understand the various classical and contemporary theories of educational psychology that provide a perspective on the implications of teaching-learning processes on learners. Key educational psychology theories on language development, moral development, cognitive development including perspectives on information processing, intelligence theories, and learning theories, physical development specifically focusing on adolescent growth and well-being, and psycho-social emotional development including ecological systems theory will be discussed with a focus to bring forth key aspects of development, learning and classroom processes that need attention in the work of a teacher. Aspects of adolescent school life, issues of punishment, bullying, and competition, that are significant to understand the role of teaching-learning within a school space situated in the Indian context will be explored. Typical and atypical learning trajectories will be briefly discussed to understand the uniqueness of every individual, providing some insight into learning disabilities and certain universal teaching-learning processes. The course will involve several practical and reflective experiences and tasks to draw out some aspects of being in the role of a teacher.

Kit Experiments in Electricity and Magnetism
The Course
The electromagnetic force unifying electrical and magnetic forces, is one of the four fundamental forces. With gravitation, it is one of the two manifesting at a macroscopic level. A course on electricity and magnetism finds a place after an introduction to Newtonian mechanics. This course starts with techniques for computing electric and magnetic fields due to different charge and current distributions and leads up to the formulation of the Maxwell’s equations. It is crucial to ensure that the laboratory experience is not overlooked even when access to laboratory is limited. The regular classroom experiments were modified, ensuring that the spirit of each experiment is retained but using easily accessible material along with few specific materials sent as a Kit to each student.

Ball-drop from a tall building (à la Galileo)
We explore the physics of falling bodies by dropping various balls from the 15
th
floor (estimated to be about 45 to 50 metres) of a building and compare it with drops from lower heights. Check
this article
and the associated video first, as we discuss the physics behind that activity here.
When an object such as a tennis ball is dropped from a height, the collision it makes with the ground or floor may be inelastic or elastic to various degrees. If it is perfectly elastic, we expect it to bounce to the same height owing to energy conservation. Otherwise the restitution coefficient determines how far back it bounces to. But is the restitution coefficient a constant, and in what régime? In other words, should bounce-back fraction of height not be dependent on the height you drop it from?
A bunch of us took a sampling of balls such as basketball, tennis ball, a steel bob to test this: on dropping them to the floor in a room from heights of the order of a metre, the tennis ball bounced back to about
2
⁄
3
of its drop height. The steel ball actually didn’t do that well (even though we all
know
that steel is more elastic than rubber! Interestingly, the steel bob would bounce back higher than a rubber ball when the collision is against another steel bob although it’s a bit harder to aim…but think of Newton’s Cradle). The basketball’s elasticity stems, to a large extent, from the air pressure inside as we all know.
So if you drop these balls onto tiled ground from the 15
th
floor of a tall building, how high would they bounce? Check the video!
So they all bounce to no greater than the 3
rd
or the 4
th
floor whereas we expect it to go to the 10
th
floor (steel not tested so as not to break infrastructure!). To explain this anomaly, one could model the restitution for normal drop tests for various materials of the ball (such as this
work
pointed out by Nandita). Let’s take a look at the individual physical processes: we shall discuss two important physical ideas behind the lacklustre performance of the ball.
One is the air viscosity, and check if the reason is the same as why raindrops don’t fall with bullet speeds. The air around the ball could be said to undergo Stokes’ flow, i.e. laminar, if the dimensionless Reynolds’ number
R
is small (say, less than unity). Given enough time, the ball may attain a sizeable fraction of its terminal velocity. Let the radius of the tennis ball be 3.5
c
m
, its mass 60
g
, and the viscosity of air be
1E
‑5
P
a
.
s
at a density of 1.2
k
g
/
m
3
. Though it is a spherical shell and hence slightly different, we’ll use an average density and go ahead with Stokes’ analysis for a uniform sphere (an interesting question would be if that’s ok?). We actually require just the mass of the ball, and because of the large density ratio between the ball and air we may neglect buoyancy too. We obtain using above values, the time required to reach 95% of terminal velocity (equivalently, to be within a respectable 5% error margin) or 90000
m
/
s
as 27000
s
. Newtonian kinematic equations suggest a more realistic time spent in free fall as 3
s
during which it gains a velocity of about 30
m
/
s
(calculations courtesy Jayanth Vyasanakere).
The Reynolds number from this simplistic analysis is also huge: a billion! Obviously then, the viscous drag on the ball cannot be laminar, so the flow of air around it might be turbulent. Even without detailed calculation, one notices the immediate effect of turbulence with the drag being proportional to the square of the velocity instead of being linear as in laminar flow.
Another contributing factor could be related to what is a serious issue in the oil and natural gas industry, known as
subsidence
. Quite simply the ground underneath may have sunk a bit upon impact, thereby taking some of the available kinetic energy (thereafter turning it to the motion of sand particles, heat etc.) and making the collision a lot more inelastic than one would imagine. Probably the same as the steel bob on floor tile? The basketball, as pointed out by Alahi in the video, even made a spiral!
It’ll probably take much more effort to list down the factors to model the ball drop to any degree of higher precision.

Resolution of the LHCb ηc anomaly

resolve an important anomaly in Particle physics
It is known for 60 years now that particles like the proton and neutron are not elementary particles but are made up of more fundamental building blocks called
quark
s
—and we now know that there are six kinds of quarks.
The interaction between particles at high energies is described in terms of the interactions between quarks and related particles called gluons within a theoretical framework called Quantum Chromodynamics (
QCD
) but the understanding of how quarks bind together to form the observed particles is still lacking.
This is one of the big open problems in particle physics but some progress has been made in understanding the bound states of heavier quarks (called charm and bottom quarks) using a theory derived from
QCD
called
NRQCD
(Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics).
Within
NRQCD
, it is possible to rigorously analyse the production of the bound states of charm quarks and while this theory explains several features of experimental data, it fails some crucial tests. One such test is the production of a charm quark bound-state called the eta_c.
In a paper written by K Sridhar and his collaborator way back in 2010, they predicted, using
NRQCD
, the number of eta_​c events that should be seen at the Large Hadron Collider in
CERN
. The experimental results were published four years later and were seen to be much smaller than the theoretical predictions — almost by a factor of hundred!
There has been no successful explanation of this discrepancy but more recently with his collaborators, Biswal and Mishra, Sridhar formulated a modified theoretical framework called
Modified
NRQCD
which predicts exactly the number of events that the
LHC
experiment has measured.
Their theoretical results are genuine predictions with no adjustable parameters and the remarkable agreement with the data suggests that their modified theory is coming closer to apprehending the true dynamics of the bound-state formation of quarks.

Quantum mechanics represents a major progress in understanding nature. Its successes range from subatomic phenomena through everyday technology to stellar scales. Classical physics, which the students would have learnt in their earlier semesters turns out to be a limiting case of quantum mechanics. So it is important that every physics student takes this course. While the conceptual foundations of quantum theory are still being debated and its applications to real systems can be quite involved, the basic algorithm can be learnt comfortably by undergraduate students. Some mathematical topics can be included in the course to make it self-contained.

Much of undergraduate teaching in physics ends much before the student is exposed to the more contemporary research areas. This is because in a subject like physics the amount of training that is required before the student can even be exposed to these areas is daunting and cannot be done at the undergraduate level. On the other hand, it makes little sense if the students have a degree in physics and not be able to get some picture, however rudimentary, of the breadth and depth of the subject. The idea in these courses is to get the student to grapple with experimental information that we have about the world at these disparate scales, to get an understanding of the ingenuity required in setting up experiments that help us glean these secrets of the universe and to imagine the kind of theoretical modelling that may shed some light on the phenomena. Instead of rigour, a broad-based understanding of the topics: making quick and rough estimates, identifying relevant and irrelevant variables in the problem, arriving at useful approximations, dimensional arguments, order-of-magnitude estimations and qualitative reasoning, all-in all a useful part of the toolkit of physicists, should be the focus of the learning process. In addition to working with textbooks, this course aims to introduce the students to primary material such as original or review papers as well as inform the
​
’
context’ of these discoveries through historical, analytical or biographical accounts.
In this first part of the course, a demonstration of how concepts from quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics could be applied to explain the nature of matter and radiation at atomic and subatomic level is undertaken. We then take a look at the current understanding of objects and phenomena of the universe.

Resolution of the LHCb ηc anomaly
Journal of High Energy Physics,
May 2023
Read Online
Abstract
Due to the heavy-quark symmetry of Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (
NRQCD
), the cross-section for the production of
η
c
can be
predicted
. This
NRQCD
prediction when confronted with data from the LHCb is seen to fail miserably. We address this LHCb
η
c
anomaly in this paper using a new approach called modified
NRQCD
, an approach that has been shown to work extremely well for studying
J/​ψ
,
ψ
′ and
χ
c
production at the
LHC
. We show, in the present paper, that the predictions for
η
c
production agrees very well with LHCb measurements at the three different values of energy that the experiment has presented data for. Modified
NRQCD
also explains the intriguing agreement of the LHCb
η
c
data with the colour-singlet prediction. The remarkable agreement of the theoretical predictions with the LHCb data suggests that modified
NRQCD
is closer to apprehending the true dynamics of quarkonium production.

Mathematical Methods in Physics
II
Everyday math for a physicist!
Facilitators
Sridhar K
Jayanth Vyasanakere
The unifying theme of
​
“
Mathematics for Physics 2” is linear algebra. This course aims to demonstrate the far reaching ideas of linear algebra in physics while building necessary mathematical foundations for other physics courses.
The course will begin with a review of basic algebra of complex numbers and matrices. It will then progress into linear transformations of vectors by matrices to illustrate the ideas of linear algebra: linear independence, decomposition of a vector into orthonormal basis vectors and eigenvectors of linear transformations.
Fourier series will be introduced as an infinite dimensional generalization of decomposition of a vector, thereby generalizing the ideas of linear vector spaces to infinite dimensions.
Finally, differential equations will also be cast in the linear algebra language, and we will look at transformations of functions by linear differential operators, and solutions of linear differential equations as functions in a linear vector space.

During the semester, we will consider a wide range of sonic, social, ethical, political, and ideological issues raised by the medium of radio . These issues include the status of radio across time, uses of editing, soundtrack, sound/​image relationships, as well as the shaping of audio material into narrative and non-narrative forms. In sum, we will examine the different choices available to practitioners who seek to use the medium as well as the implications of such choices. To do so, we’ll use a wide range of radio programs from all over the world. We’ll also pair our practice with academic articles, interviews, studio and museum visits, interactions with practitioners , that will contextualize radio as a medium and serve as the basis for our discussions.

The course emphasizes on the technical and conceptual skills for documentary creation and encourages students to explore the experimental possibilities of documentary. Students will use the learning from texts on documentary history, culture and distribution and ethical concerns of documentary making in their own documentary production. Through practical exercises and readings on contemporary issues and media theory, the course will develop meaningful vocabulary of documentary and provide a forum to challenge and experiment with the medium.

There is a plethora of data available in the public domain that has led to a proliferation of stories, reportage and hence policy implications based on data.  There is also a growing tendency to obfuscate using data. What data hides can sometimes be more important than what is revealed. Therefore, while a strong grasp on statistical methods is important to cull out meaningful information from data, it is equally or more important to do so keeping ethical data analysis and mining principles. However, statistical literacy and application is often fraught with incorrect inferences based on imperfect assumptions. This course aims to equip students to apply some fundamental principles of statistics and exploratory data analysis on real data. Real data can come from a variety of sources. It would include data arising from surveys and also include programme data arising from social policies that are dynamic in nature. Given the diverse nature of data collection and representation, a good grounding in statistical methods is critical in conducting ethically sound evidence based policy analysis and fostering a culture of public reasoning using data.
The statistical concepts covered in the course include the ability to quantify uncertainty, some aspects of descriptive statistics, inferential principles, and exposure to selected advanced techniques of statistical machine learning. For the purposes of communicating effectively using data, this course also aims to simplify the process of data-based information dissemination.

Students are introduced to ideas of structural violence, poverty, constitutional principles, transparency, and accountability in governance. This course helps study the applicational use of the Right to Information Act (2005). As the Act has made some positive strides to enable the governments commitment to transparency and accountability, but this process of understanding still continues to be patchy.
To facilitate governance, various governments over the years have introduced Information Technology (
IT
) in almost all affairs of governance as a nod to e‑governance. This, in turn, has meant that data corresponding to many public programs are available in the public domain but not all of them are easily accessible to the common people.
There is an urgent need for many people to play an intermediary role in demystifying complex information from the public domain. These require an analytical mindset and skills such as programming, statistics, ability to extract, transform, and summarize data. This course offers the introductory step to understand and how data can complied for further analysis.

Physics is the study of matter and energy and their interactions in space and time. As students of the sciences, you need an understanding of physics to be able to compare phenomena to basic physical models. In this course, we help you recognise the relevance of physics to biology at the microscopic and molecular and macroscopic level. It will help you as biology students to understand important concepts in biology and chemistry that rely on physics. You will learn broad physical principles that govern the world around us.
The beauty of the subject of physics and its study of our universe is that the same fundamental principles apply to all systems across all scales from galaxies to atoms. This idea is central to the design of this course. We examine principles that can be applied to all physical phenomena (motion, light, sound, heat, and electricity) and properties of matter. You will work on describing physical phenomena in multiple ways – using words, equations, graphs, and diagrams. We will see what representation is useful for and make inferences about systems based on representations. We will train you to interpret knowledge obtained by reading scientific text in reasoning and problem solving and use simple mathematical tools to solve elementary problems in the areas of physics covered in this course.

Offered At
Campus
Bengaluru
This is a core course offered to the second year physics major students with Mechanics (
PHY-102
) as the prerequisite. The electromagnetic force, unifying electrical and magnetic forces, is one of the four fundamental forces and essentially responsible for almost all physical phenomena encountered in day-to-day experience. This includes static charges, lightning, electricity and high voltage power lines, permanent and electromagnets in domestic or industrial appliances, electromagnetic fields, mobile phones, radio transmitters and electromagnetic radiation. The course follows a traditional approach beginning with the Coulomb’s inverse square law force between stationary charges and currents, culminating in the Maxwell formulation of electromagnetism followed by a preliminary discussion of electromagnetic waves. The mathematical tools to develop the theory of static and dynamic properties of electric and magnetic fields in vacuum and matter include vector calculus and curvilinear coordinate systems which will be reviewed within the course.

Resolution of the LHCb ηc anomaly
Sridhar K
,
Sudhansu S Biswal
and
Sushree S Mishra
resolve an important anomaly in Particle physics
It is known for 60 years now that particles like the proton and neutron are not elementary particles but are made up of more fundamental building blocks called
quark
s
—and we now know that there are six kinds of quarks.
The interaction between particles at high energies is described in terms of the interactions between quarks and related particles called gluons within a theoretical framework called Quantum Chromodynamics (
QCD
) but the understanding of how quarks bind together to form the observed particles is still lacking.
This is one of the big open problems in particle physics but some progress has been made in understanding the bound states of heavier quarks (called charm and bottom quarks) using a theory derived from
QCD
called
NRQCD
(Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics).
Within
NRQCD
, it is possible to rigorously analyse the production of the bound states of charm quarks and while this theory explains several features of experimental data, it fails some crucial tests. One such test is the production of a charm quark bound-state called the eta_c.
In a paper written by K Sridhar and his collaborator way back in 2010, they predicted, using
NRQCD
, the number of eta_​c events that should be seen at the Large Hadron Collider in
CERN
. The experimental results were published four years later and were seen to be much smaller than the theoretical predictions — almost by a factor of hundred!
There has been no successful explanation of this discrepancy but more recently with his collaborators, Biswal and Mishra, Sridhar formulated a modified theoretical framework called
Modified
NRQCD
which predicts exactly the number of events that the
LHC
experiment has measured.
Their theoretical results are genuine predictions with no adjustable parameters and the remarkable agreement with the data suggests that their modified theory is coming closer to apprehending the true dynamics of the bound-state formation of quarks.

The Indian labour market through the lens of public sector recruitment
Insights from the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (
TNPSC
) to inform labour market policy and improve recruitment practice
TNPSC
is a constitutional body within the government of Tamil Nadu. It is responsible for conducting the exams that are used to recruit staff for administrative posts in the state’s various government departments. Because these jobs are so coveted, millions of people apply for them every year, making government recruitment an important component of the labour market.
This report uses data from
TNPSC
and a survey of over 3,000 candidates appearing for
TNPSC
exams to shed light on policy-relevant questions about the recruitment process:
Who applies?
Why do they apply?
Why are people willing to invest so much in exam preparation?
Why are people willing to gamble on such low odd
s
of getting selected?
What is the best way of structuring recruitments for both candidates and the government?
The report aims to demonstrate how a deeper understanding of the recruitment process and candidate application behaviour can help us tackle some of the most pressing issues in the Indian labour market today, including the causes of educated unemployment, low female labour force participation, a lack of skill development, and more.
Key suggestions
Recruitment agencies should consider employing data analysts
Household surveys should include questions that
identify candidates
preparing for competitive exams
Recruitment agencies should try to educate candidates about the selection process
To address the problem of educated unemployment, focus on supply, not
just demand
Recruitment agencies should be mindful of how
their policy decisions
affect the labour market.

Biography
Kripa has a Bachelor’s degree in physics from the University of Madras and a Master’s degree from
IIT
, Madras. She did her PhD at Raman Research Institute, Bangalore, broadly in the growing interdisciplinary area of physics in biology, and specifically on mathematical modelling of physical forces on the eukaryotic cell surface. She particularly enjoys the collaborative nature of work in this area and learned a lot about biology and experimentation from her peers. During her post doctoral work at University of California in Davis, she worked on self organization of spindles during cell division. She is interested in undergraduate teaching and research, because she believes that students of that age are highly enthusiastic, sharp and observant, but are not given enough opportunities in the prevailing education system. She would like to develop classroom demonstrations and involve students in simple research projects that are both highly educational and that could contribute to scientific research. Her research interests are broadly in the area of Physics in Biology, Statistical Mechanics and Physics Education.

Biography
Sravanti’s training and research background span biology, bioengineering and biophysics.  Her undergraduate education was in biology at the McMaster University, Canada. Subsequently, she completed a masters in bioengineering at the University of Toronto. During her PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization, Goettingen, Germany, she used ideas and tools from soft condensed matter physics to understand the motility and rheology of unicellular parasites. Following this, she performed research at Princeton University as a postdoctoral fellow in developmental biology.
At Azim Premji University, she works primarily with undergraduate students to pursue questions that are broadly in the areas of developmental and regenerative biology. Along with the team she conducts experiments to ask how organisms establish a body plan by cell sorting, what kinds of environments promote growth and regeneration and how interspecies interactions influence individual development and populations.
With other faculty members in the Biology group of the university she has co-authored a free online introductory biology textbook called i Think Biology (
https://​ithinkbi​ol​o​gy​.in/
). This unique textbook utilises a case-study-based approach with examples from India, that is accessible, self-contained, and prioritises essential capacities over content.

Thermal Physics
A study of processes that involve energy and entropy.
Facilitator
Kripa Gowrishankar
Specialisation
Thermal Physics
This is a level 2 core course for Physics Majors that introduces the students to a statistical way of thinking about many particle systems. Prerequisites for this course are Mechanics
PHY
102 and Electromagnetism
PHY201
. The subject though traditionally thought of as
​
‘
heat’ includes the study of processes which involve both energy and entropy (i.e. randomness). Applications go beyond physics into chemistry and biology and the energy and chemical industries.
The course attempts to combine both a molecular level understanding of macroscopic systems and the traditional thermodynamics that provides a framework for relating the macroscopic properties of a system to one another. After introducing the concepts of heat, temperature, pressure, work and energy, a molecular approach is used to describe ideal gasses through kinetic theory.
A simplified description of Maxwell Boltzmann distribution and equipartition of energy is followed by a molecular model of transport properties in gasses such as viscosity, thermal conductivity and diffusion. A molecular description of entropy of an ideal gas, Gibbs paradox, Brownian motion and Langevin’s theory are other topics that are briefly introduced.
The latter half of the course deals with laws of thermodynamics, its application to heat engines, Carnot cycle, Clausius inequality, the entropy of an ideal gas, concept of minimization of free energy and few examples of its application in real world systems. The labs that will be held in parallel with the lectures help to quantify some of the abstract concepts.
Verification of gas laws, specific heat capacities of an ideal gas, measuring diffusion constant, microscopic observation of Brownian motion and determining Boltzmann constant, constructing a heat engine, reverse osmosis through artificial membranes are some of the experiments that will be done by the students.

Facilitator
Kripa Gowrishankar
Programming and computation are essential components in a physics students’ box of tools. This course is an introduction to the basics of programming in the language Python and does not assume any prior knowledge of computer programming. We will first focus on developing our logical and algorithmic thinking, while learning the python language. We will then be introduced to some important methods in numerical computation using Python. We will use these to revisit to some familiar concepts from mathematics and physics.

Introduction to Climate Science 1
Understand the earth’s climate system through foundational physical concepts
Facilitator
Kripa Gowrishankar
The climate emergency is an existential issue that we need to engage with at many levels. As a beginning we need to start educating ourselves about the climate. But how does one think about such a vast and complex system? In this course, we start from scratch and first grasp the various foundational physical concepts that are needed for a grounded understanding of climate change. We’ll then consider the earth’s climate as a complex, interconnected system and understand how climate scientists view it, using a framework of feedback loops and tipping points.

The course content attempts to maintain a judicious balance between a statistical approach to molecular systems and the traditional thermodynamic approach which provides a framework for relating the macroscopic properties of a system to one another. The topics covered here also provide the essential background for electives such as solid- state physics, soft condensed matter, astrophysics and biophysics offered further ahead in the physics programme. The emphasis in the pedagogy is to introduce abstract concepts like heat, work and entropy through specific examples and then more generally; reinforcing them further through laboratory based experiments and computational exercises.

Undergraduate Occupational Minor
Explore interdisciplinary themes with courses in Climate Studies, Music Education, Data and Democracy, Media and Journalism, Sports and Fitness, Technology for Social good and others.
The four-year
BA
and BSc Honours programme curriculum is divided into five key components:
Disciplinary Major
(Sciences | Social Sciences | Humanities)
Occupational Minor
(Inter-disciplinary Themes)
Common Curriculum
(Foundational Capacities)
Flexible Credits
(with the option of a Disciplinary Minor)
Research or Internship
(in the fourth year of Study)
What is an Occupational Minor?
The occupational minor is an integral part of our academic framework that will enhance the educational experience of our students. It will provide them with an opportunity to gain specific knowledge and skills in a field that complements their chosen major.
The occupational minor is an innovative interdisciplinary theme designed to provide students with a deep understanding of current global and Indian social, political, cultural, and ecological conditions while equipping them with the skills and tools necessary for occupational readiness.
This track offers a range of courses to choose from, allowing students to tailor their education to their specific interests and career goals. These courses include Climate Studies, Data and Democracy, Media and Journalism, Education, Sports and Fitness, Technology for Social Good, Biodiversity Conservation, Design for Communities, Music Education etc.
The minor is structured around three key elements:
1. Perspectives:
Students will embark on a journey of acquiring foundational perspectives critical to developing a nuanced understanding of their chosen domain. These courses will provide the necessary intellectual framework for exploring and engaging with real-world issues.
2. Skills:
The programme will equip students with practical knowledge that is directly applicable to various work situations. This practical training will help our graduates stand out in the job market and excel in their chosen careers.
3. Field Immersion/​ Internship:
To ensure a well-rounded education, students will have the invaluable opportunity to gain direct exposure to the realities of their chosen field. The internship (in the seventh semester) prepares students to further deepen their understanding and capabilities and allows for different pathways into higher education or entry into the workforce. Students opting to join the workforce will do a semester-long interdisciplinary occupational internship.
The occupational minor will empower our students to not only gain a deeper understanding of the world around them but also to make a meaningful impact through their work and further studies. Students who graduate with a four-year degree will be fully ready for the workforce or direct entry into a PhD programme.
Key details about the occupational minor
1. Complementary Skill Development:
The occupational minor is designed to offer students a well-rounded education. While their major focuses on their primary area of academic interest, the minor allows them to acquire valuable skills in a related or complementary field. This not only broadens their knowledge but also enhances their versatility in the job market.
2. Real-World Readiness:
The courses within the occupational minor are carefully curated to ensure that students gain practical knowledge that is directly applicable in professional settings. This translates to increased employability and the ability to make meaningful contributions to their chosen careers from day one.
3. Personalised Learning:
Students have the flexibility to choose an occupational minor that aligns with their career goals and interests. This individualised approach allows them to tailor their education to their specific aspirations and enhances their academic journey.
Students can opt for
an Occupational minor
in any one of the indicative areas listed below:
Music Education
Design for communities
Sports and Fitness
Data, Democracy and Development
Climate Studies
Technology for Social Good
Biodiversity Conservation
Education
Media and Journalism

Undergraduate Flexible Credits
Craft your learning experience
The National Education Policy, 2020 (
NEP
) has proposed that a 4‑year multidisciplinary bachelor’s programme
​
“
shall be the preferred option since it allows the opportunity to experience the full range of holistic and multidisciplinary education in addition to a focus on the chosen major and minors as per the choices of the student”. Further, the policy recommends that
​
“
Imaginative and flexible curricular structures will enable creative combinations of disciplines for study, thus, removing currently prevalent rigid boundaries and creating new possibilities for lifelong learning”.
This section details how the Undergraduate learning experience has woven the Flexible course component into the overall curricular structure of the 4‑year programme.
Flexible credit
is a component of the 4‑year Undergraduate programme. All students will have a number of courses that they can opt to craft their own educational experience.
Frequently Asked Questions
1. How many topics or Courses can one do under this Flexible credits components?
A student can do 7 courses throughout the 4‑years of their study to customise their educational experience and pursue themes of their interest. Students opt for Flexible credit courses in semesters 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 (2 courses) and during the summer breaks. This change is based on the Academic Calendar.
2. What are the possible options by which I can make best use of flexible credits?
The possible options are:
Explore courses in other disciplines (Majors) and standalone courses
Minor in another discipline
Additional electives in the Major
Supporting courses (for students requiring English/​Mathematics support)
Note:
Enrolling for a flexible course in Semester‑1 also provides the option of changing the Major in the first semester. (This is at the discretion of the University and selection criteria that the student must fulfill to change to a new Major).
3. Are all Majors available as a Disciplinary Minor to opt via the Flexible credits?
Yes. Potentially, all the Majors
except
PPE
could be a Disciplinary Minor of study if a student opts for courses from that specific Discipline.  For example, a student in Major Economics or Major Biology can opt for a course from Information Sciences in Semester 1, i.e.,
​
‘
Craft of Computing’. Please note that all courses/​topics in a Major may not be available for a flexible credit course. Some courses in a Major, especially the ones offered in the second and third year, will have pre-requisites and is not open for other Majors’ students. The list of Flexible credit courses will be announced before the beginning of every semester.
4. How many courses/​topics should one take to be eligible for a Disciplinary Minor?
A student should do a minimum of 5 courses to be eligible for a Disciplinary Minor.

Possible flexible credit pathways for a student majoring in Economics with Climate Studies as an Occupational Minor are listed below:
Student 1:
Enrols in all courses of Philosophy and will be eligible for a Disciplinary Minor in Philosophy
Student 2
: Enrols in Philosophy in the first semester. In the second semester, no flexible credits and does a mix of Disciplines and standalone courses thereafter, will not be eligible for a Disciplinary Minor
Student 3
: Enrols in Information Science major course and does 5 courses in History from Semester 3 onwards will be eligible for History Minor
6. How does a minor work for summer programme students?
Minor works differently for Summer programme students. They must start in their third semester or the summer after the second semester (if a course is offered).
7. How many flexible courses does a BSc BEd programme entail?
For BScBEd, there are only 5 flexible courses
8. Are there any Minors on offer that is not a Major?
Yes. The following are offered as a Minor for the Class of 2023 – 2027 at our Bengaluru campus: Gender Studies | Statistics | Psychology.

Undergraduate Common Curriculum
Experience a truly multidisciplinary higher education
The common curriculum, one of the important components of the 4‑year Undergraduate Programmes at Azim Premji University will introduce students to the study of the themes that emphasise and build:
Critical thinking and Analytical abilities
Sensibilities for dialogue and reflection
Co-operative learning.
While these capacities evolve and develop over a lifetime, the common curriculum is expected to be a rich initiation into this process. The common curriculum also prepares them with the skills to effectively engage as members of society.
Curricular Components
While the 4‑year programme curriculum will rigorously train students in a discipline of their choice in a manner that prepares them for employment stemming from the discipline or further study, the common curriculum provides students with skills and competencies for the 21
st
century as part of their undergraduate learning experience.
The common curriculum also allows students to fully experience a multidisciplinary higher education environment and has the following components.
FOUNDATIONS
Communication:
The ability to critically engage with ideas and to express one’s thought with felicity and flair is supported by exposure to language and writing of exemplary quality.
Drawing from literary and technical writing , students will engage with and develop critical reading and analytical ability through a set of courses spread across Semesters 1 and 2. Effective writing and oral communication will be encouraged though the course work.
Reasoning and critical reflection:
The common curriculum will include a few courses, that emphasise
critical thinking, logic and argument, public reasoning
and open-ended dialogue around social and personal issues. The nature, similarities and differences between scientific, social scientific and humanistic thought will be addressed.
Courses :
Critical Reading and Writing
(In Semesters 1 and 2),
Public Reasoning
(Semester 2)
CREATIVE
EXPRESSIONS
We relate to the world not only through the intellect but also with our bodies and creative abilities. In this set of courses and workshops, you will explore aesthetic, physical and expressive traditions.
Introducing students to the dimensions of multi-modal understanding through work and play in activities seemingly as diverse as sport, games, dance, pottery, farming, martial arts and theatre will be a key part of this section of the common curriculum.
Courses in the ambit of this section are likely to be designed as short workshops in an artistic domain of the student’s choice.
https://​azim​premji​u​ni​ver​si​ty​.edu​.in/​c​o​u​r​s​e​s​/​c​r​e​a​t​i​v​e​-​e​x​p​r​e​s​s​i​o​n​-​c​o​urses
UNDERSTANDING
INDIA
In these courses, we will explore the nature and diversity of the Indian experience. We study the vast diversity of historical, cultural and linguistic aspects that define Indianness. You will learn to understand how the subcontinent has changed in its environment, across geography, geology and territory.
We will think together about debates on the people who live here, their culture, and the larger questions around population and inequality. Most importantly, we examine the many structures that organise Indian society.
The Understanding India component has the following courses.
The Many Pasts of India Present
Who is Indian

Biodiversity conservation, management, and habitat restoration requires a multi-pronged approach, and an interdisciplinary understanding is essential. This
OT
will acquaint students with the rich biodiversity of the Indian subcontinent and the associated threats to them, and provide the students with the lens to identify pertinent questions such as —
what
to conserve,
why
to conserve,
when
to conserve, and
how
to conserve. The field of conservation binds the need for species and ecosystem conservation with the requirements for human well-being, livelihood, and rights. Through this curriculum, the students will be aware of the interdisciplinary approach in this field and will be able to identify the gaps in the existing policies that will help bridge the gaps between the need for conservation and the welfare of society. Through the courses in the
OT
, students will be able to examine conservation issues from multiple perspectives.

Eureka from the Cardboard House
Shreyansh Tripathy
,
Sourabh Panda
and
Kinshuk Ghosh,
with
Kripa Gowrishankar
, managed to
​
“
see” sound after recreating an old experiment called Schlieren imaging.
#$%
&
Yes!
Brooo!!! Woohoo!
Re-record record kar!
Record kar raha hoon.
Kitna gaali diya maine…
<nervous giggles>
Bhai… it looks so perfect, yaar!
Kripa! Call Kripa!
That morning, Kripa Gowrishankar received a frenetic phone call from her second-year students Shreyansh Tripathy, Sourabh Panda (BSc in Physics, 2023 – 2027) and Kinshuk Ghosh (BSc BEd, 2023 – 2027).
“
Did you hear? Did you hear? It worked!” She immediately knew what this meant. For close to a week, her class of physics undergraduates had been working on their class project marking the end of their Waves course. This particular group had been attempting an experiment to see sound waves with their naked eyes.
Sound can be heard, obviously. Its vibrations can be felt. But what does it mean to
​
“
see” sound?
“
There are a number of ways to visualise waves,” explains Kripa, a physics faculty member at Azim Premji University.
​
“
One is the
ripple tank
, where a sound generated underwater creates ripples through which you can observe phenomena like interference, refraction and reflection.”
The ripple tank was a commonly demonstrated classroom experiment at the University. While it effectively demonstrates the behaviour of waves in general, Kripa notes that it doesn’t really help to understand sound waves specifically. Schlieren imaging, on the other hand, does.
Kripa Gowrishankar with her students Shreyansh Tripathy, Sourabh Panda and Kinshuk Ghosh (left to right).
Schlieren imaging — sometimes called shadowgraphy — is an old technique in photography used to visualise density variations in transparent media. Turns out, that is pretty much what sound is!
Sound occurs when a source (say, a speaker) creates a disturbance to the molecules in the surrounding medium (say, air). The disturbance causes the molecules to vibrate, and this vibration is transported along the other particles of the medium in the form of a longitudinal wave.
As a sound wave travels, air molecules vibrate toward and away from each other, and there emerges areas with high density (more molecules) and low density (fewer molecules). Without particles in a medium, there would be no sound — explains why you cannot hear anything in vacuum.
“
With Schlieren imaging, you are actually seeing the damn sound!” emphasises Kripa,
​
“
You are seeing the pressure difference that it is creating. It is not some trick.” Her enthusiasm rubbed off on Shreyansh, Kinshuk and Sourabh, and they decided to take on the challenge of performing the experiment for the class project.
On paper, the set-up seemed simple enough. A light is shone on a mirror, and the reflected light is focused at a point and captured by a concave mirror. The disturbance, in this case sound from a speaker, is placed in the path of the light. A knife edge is placed at the focal point of the reflected light. When the speaker is turned on, sound waves start emanating from it causing a change in the density of the air above it. The knife edge blocks out the light that is bent by the disturbed air, and this causes those sections of the image to be darkened. The result, visible sound waves!
No one at the University had ever attempted this before. Even though there were resources online explaining how this could be done, there was no ready-made set-up and there was not a lot of time before project presentation day.
Expectedly, the stumbling blocks were many — how strong should their light source be? Why was their spherical mirror not working?
​
“
We tried a shaving mirror, different kinds of screens,” says Shreyansh.
​
“
We tried to make our own
LED
source. We used matchsticks, even a blowtorch!” Sourabh add
s
.

“
I was a person who did not enjoy physics much, I was scared of it.
Seeing
sound changed my opinion. I think if students start a course with this mindset, they will find it manageable. They will see, like me, that maybe there is some magic in physics.”
Kinshuk Ghosh (BSc BEd, 2023–2027)
It was the end of a strenuous semester for all the students, but they powered through.
​
“
We were spending all our time in the lab. We once slept over because we were just so into it,” says Shreyansh.
At some point, they realised that to improve their quality of images, they needed a dark room to perform the experiment in. Knowing very well that they would need to create one themselves, they turned to recycled cardboard. In a matter of hours, there cropped up a rickety cardboard
​
‘
house’ in a corner of the physics lab.
In spite of their persistence and creativity, the sound waves still eluded them. With hours left before the presentation, their hope dwindled but the trio were determined to keep trying until the last minute. There were just about 10 minutes to go, when suddenly, the screen in front of them flickered. There they were! The sound waves, drifting along in all their longitudinal glory.
As soon as she received the call, Kripa rushed to the lab to confirm if her hunch was right.
​
“
By the time I arrived, they were jumping all around,” she says, amused.
​
“
Their setup had not been successful until that day and I had been reassuring them that it was okay. They tried. Ten minutes before the presentation, it all came together. It was a total adrenaline rush!”
Kinshuk, a BSc BEd student aspiring to be an educationist, admits that he entered the project with plenty of apprehensions.
​
“
I was a person who did not enjoy physics much, I was scared of it.
Seeing
sound changed my opinion. I think if students start a course with this mindset, they will find it manageable. They will see, like me, that maybe there is some magic in physics.”
The trio pose triumphantly in front of their cardboard
​
‘
house’.

The Worm That Cannot Be Named: Pond Today, Gone Tomorrow (Part-II)
After discovering a strange organism in their backyard, a group of young biologists grapple with a pandemic and climate change to keep their investigations going.
The Worm That Cannot Be Named: A New Species in Sompura? (Part I)
Unidentified creature in local pond sparks biodiversity exploration and climate change awareness among biology students
Read Part I here
Doing biological experiments at home was all about improvisation. For example, Risha used paper mache to create a makeshift test-tube holder; the plastic tops of drinking water cans doubled up as petri plates. They managed to do a number of experiments in this manner, including some of the amputation tests needed for Anjali to study wound healing in the worms.
While Risha’s parents were used to their home becoming a site of odd science experiments, their conservative grandmother would not approve of the beef liver they needed to store at home to feed the worms. For a while, Risha hid the beef liver in their room, inside iced thermocol boxes. Eventually, seeing how serious the project was to them, their parents allowed Risha to use the freezer. The only rule was to not tell grandma.
When Risha got back to campus in 2021, they began trials to extract the algae from the worm. They also designed experiments to study how the worms responded to mechanical stimulus and quantified movement. While Risha was not able to complete everything they started, they did manage to spend some time exploring the aspect of the project that fascinated them the most — the ecosystem of Sompura’s ponds.

“
Sometimes, as I looked under the microscope, I wondered why I was studying the worms this way… Rather than looking at them as an object of research, would it not have been cooler if I could just — I do not know — be with them?” they deliberate. And so Risha started spending more time at the ponds, observing the sights and sounds, sometimes for hours at a time.
Enigmatic ponds of Sompura
One of the ponds they frequented was nestled between trees and alligator weed. Birds like kingfishers were commonplace and Risha even spotted wild rabbits rustling in the thickets a few times. They encountered planaria floating on the surface, red larvae of midge flies, a strange shrimp and a long worm filled with little eggs.
​
“
Once, I came across a hydra hanging on to a little leaf on the side. After that, all I wanted to do was visit every single pond and look for more of those. There were so many things that I would find and I had no idea what they were,” says Risha.
Many of these ponds would completely dry up in the summers. What was happening to all the living creatures that lived in the water during this time? How were they able to re-appear when the ponds did? Were they going into some kind of hibernation, burrowing themselves in the soil, or forming cysts? The mysteries of the life cycles of these organisms occupied Risha’s mind and she still thinks about them today.
Besides observing the various idiosyncrasies of Sompura’s ponds, the other thing that Risha enjoyed was sharing their experiences. When Aastha Vartak joined Sravanti as a Research Assistant in 2021, it was Risha who guided her to the usual haunts of the green worms. By then Risha had developed a good instinct for where the creatures were likely to exist, based on the microhabitats they had shown to prefer.
Since Risha lived in Bengaluru, she was able to continue some experiments at home during the time of the
COVID-19
lockdown.

It is not easy for someone new to get used to the Sompura landscape. Being temporary, many of these ponds did not have names and were not marked on online maps. Over the years, Sravanti and the young researchers came up with their own naming convention for them, such as the weaver bird pond and the cattle pond. By the time Risha finished her part in the project, Aastha had a good enough sense of how to find the ponds. The Sompura green worms were in good hands.
The group had still not managed to establish a lab population of the worms. This meant that when the ponds dried up every year, experiments would have to pause. The researchers were highly insecure about this because they were completely at the mercy of the occasionally erratic monsoons. Moreover, being a peri-urban area, the whole locality was in transition. Any day now, a new apartment complex could be announced, sounding the death knell for the ponds of Sompura and the green worms that inhabit them.
Struggles, and a new discovery
Even back in 2020, Anjali had seen signs of a declining population and the perils of an unpredictable pond.
​
“
Sometimes they would be filled with water, sometimes they would dry out. We did not have a way of knowing when what would happen. I was always a bit ready for the fact that these ponds would disappear anytime and the worms with them.” Her dream was to establish their pond within the campus, which could be populated with worms to keep the science going.
In her quest to find more missing pieces of the puzzle, Aastha continued many of Anjali’s experiments and tried some of her own. She found that besides beef liver, the worms seemed to like egg yolks as well, and they did seem to thrive better in the presence of an external food source.
A few months in, she shifted her focus to the perfectly symmetrical spheres that could be seen inside some worms clearly, and also at times floating in the pond water. Anjali had already identified that these were the worm’s eggs.
“
We wanted to allow for the eggs to hatch so we could have our own source of worms in the lab,” explains Aastha. She stored the eggs in a range of different temperatures inside an incubator, hoping that one of them would be in the right conditions for hatching.
Being a peri-urban area, the area around the university campus is under transition. The locations of the two ponds studied are marked and zoomed in.
One morning, to her delight, Aastha realised that it worked.
​
“
There were fewer eggs, and we could see that some had hatched. But we could not see the baby worms. We wondered where they could be,” she recollected. Only after a while, when scanning the sample under a microscope, did Aastha find the baby worms. The moment she saw the newborns, she realised that she had found an important piece of the puzzle: the babies were transparent.
​
“
It meant that the algae was not being transferred to the new generation, it was acquired somewhere along the way.”
It now became all the more relevant to understand the nature of the relationship between the algae and the worm. The fact that baby worms were born without the algae suggested that they were not a survival necessity — not for hatchlings, at least. But perhaps they were necessary for the worm’s development further in its life cycle.
When Aastha moved the transparent hatchlings into pond water containing algae, she observed that it was only a matter of time before the worms absorbed it and turned green.
Give and take
When she compared the survival of green hatchlings with transparent hatchlings, she did not find a big difference. However, the green worms grew longer, while the colourless ones decreased in length. Aastha also kept some worms in the dark, knowing that the algae would atrophy in the absence of light. Once the algae died, the worms did not live long. All of this was evidence that the algae were indeed beneficial in some way, possibly as a source of nutrition for the worms.
That is only half of the symbiosis story. Does the algae too have something to gain through this live-in situation? Aastha got an answer to this question when she performed a desiccation experiment on them.
The idea was to mimic the yearly cycle of the pond drying up. It turned out that algae freshly extracted from the worms were able to survive desiccation while free-living algae could not. It is hard to say what exactly is at play, but Aastha suspects that the worms offer some kind of protection to the algae in the dry times.
Whether or not the Sompura green worms are rediscovered, the teacher within Sravanti will always cherish how the tiny creatures managed to bring together so many successive batches of students and researchers. It also led to several spin-off projects, such as the discovery of green hydra, which is now a big part of her lab’s research.

Before her research stint at the university ended, Aastha also managed to send the worms to InSTEM for
RNA
sequencing. This technique offers information about the proteins produced in an organism. The results were not conclusive, but they did open the possibility that there is more than a single species of algae that resides in the worm.
Aastha left in 2022 with the hope that investigations into the Sompura green worm would continue. For a while it did, however, in the following monsoon season, the worms could not be located. Anjali found out about this when she bumped into Risha during a visit to Bengaluru in 2023.
​
“
I was sad to hear that, but ultimately not very surprised,” she said glumly.
“
Since it started with me, it sort of felt like my baby. This was a discovery and I got to be in charge of what to do with them, and finding out what was going on with them. Most importantly, they are just so incredibly cute.”
Anjali Paranjape
The end? Not yet
Flatworms are very understudied in our part of the world, and so it is not at all outlandish to suggest that the Sompura green worms may end up being a brand-new species. Despite fully realising the vulnerability of a peri-urban landscape, Sravanti believes that the worms are unlikely to be extinct. There is no reason for the worms to be restricting themselves to Sompura alone. She advocates for a more extensive search for them in similar ecosystems. After all, there is still so much to learn about the life cycle of these worms.
Whether or not the Sompura green worms are rediscovered, the teacher within Sravanti will always cherish how the tiny creatures managed to bring together so many successive batches of students and researchers. It also led to several spin-off projects, such as the discovery of green hydra, which is now a big part of her lab’s research.
The project turned into a way for students and researchers to keep in touch with each other, even though they have all moved on. Aastha is now pursuing a master’s in neuroscience at the National Brain Research Centre (
NBRC
), Bengaluru. Risha has just started work at Science Gallery Bengaluru, and Anjali, after completing her master’s, is now pursuing a career in academic publishing.
None of them are likely to forget the green worms any soon, especially Anjali who holds a special place for the creatures in her heart.
​
“
Since it started with me, it sort of felt like my baby. This was a discovery and I got to be in charge of what to do with them, and finding out what was going on with them. Most importantly,” she added, with a glint in her eye,
​
“
they are just so incredibly cute!”

Physics is taught at the secondary and senior secondary levels as a bunch of abstract facts that are to be represented mathematically and then manipulated to produce results. Experiments conducted in the laboratory are then supposed to verify and conform to this theoretical formulation. It is also often believed that there are
​
“
theoretical” and
​
“
correct” values of experimental quantities. The primacy of observations and measurements to the abstractions in physics are generally lost in this approach to the teaching of the subject. Students also have a view of physics that is fragmented into different branches. There is hence need for an introduction which cuts across sub-areas and builds a broader view of physics as well as the basic language and tools of the trade without a repetition of school topics. This course is an introduction to the basic approach and methods used by physics in various interesting contexts via facts, numbers, estimation, modelling, and computation.

This course is meant as a formal but gentle introduction to the basic building blocks of electronics that allows students to build simple circuits with an understanding beyond a mere hobby-level. For the budding experimental physicist, this course lays the foundation to understand, and later to build, instrumentation required to solve control and data acquisition problems in the laboratory. For the non-physicist taking this course as part of Minor or otherwise, this offers an inside-view of the components that make up the electronics around us. Applications and connections to the real world can be seen during the experiments and discussions as well as during the projects.

Visualizing Polarization
Classically, light is an electromagnetic wave– a wave of
oscillating Electric and Magnetic fields
instead of oscillating molecules of air or water like in sound or water waves. Electric and Magnetic fields are not something we can
​
“
see”, but when they oscillate in synchrony, it results in a visual phenomenon called light!
Light, a universal phenomenon that has existed since the universe began, responsible for the beautiful night sky and your existence, can be described by just four equations, collectively called the Maxwell equations:
∇
→
⋅
E
→
=
0
∇

E

∇

B

c
2
∂
E
→
∂
t
(
1
)
The above equations are
​
“
sourceless” Maxwell equations in Vacuum — whatever that means. The vectors
E
→
and
B
→
denote the variables: Electric and Magnetic fields. Rearranging to separate the equations in
E
→
and
B
→
, we get the very familiar wave equations in
E
→
and
B
→
that are identical to the wave equations in mechanical waves, say, on a guitar string! The solutions to the wave equations are oscillating Electric and Magnetic fields.
One example of a solution is

In Eqns.(2),

are amplitudes of the Electric and Magnetic fields. The oscillation comes from the
cos
⁡
(
k

)
terms, and the direction of oscillation is given by the unit vectors
y
^
and
z
^
. (Try substituting the solutions in (2) back into the Maxwell equations in (1) and verifying that they solve them.)
When we say light is linearly polarized, we mean that the Electric field (
E
→
) oscillates in one fixed direction all throughout space. For instance, the light due to (2) is linearly polarized in
y
direction.
Light coming from natural sources is generally unpolarized and can’t be written in the form of (1). But one can use polarizers, materials that allow Electric fields to oscillate only in one direction, to polarize light and make the math easy.
Oscillating vectors and their polarization may not be the easiest things to visualize, so we present a simple demonstration using a mechanical wave on a rope.
Click the buttons below to view the demonstrations set up by Pavan:
Demo 1 →
Demo 2 →
Set up:
We created circular waves on the rope by hand at one end while keeping the other end pivoted. The amplitude and direction of the oscillation of each point on the rope is analogous to the Electric field’s magnitude and direction. These oscillations of the string form a wave that propagates along the string, which is analogous to the direction of light propagation. Clearly, the oscillations are not restricted to one direction. We then introduce a slit using two rulers which acts as a polarizer, allowing a wave of oscillations only in one direction (along the slit) to pass.
In
Demo 1
, we put the rulers vertically. So when a circular wave passes through it, the resulting wave oscillates vertically while the horizontal oscillations vanish. In
Demo 2
, we add a horizontal slit, which cancels the vertical oscillation too. So we end up having no oscillation at all; that is, no light passes through two linear polarizers placed perpendicular to each other.
What would happen when we pass light through two polarizers that are at, say,
60
degree angle to each other?

Murthy initiated the idea of demonstrating polarization of light using this simple set up. We also thank Murthy for his inputs to improve the post. Pavan set up the demo.

​
“
sync
” with each other and the music. This phenomenon of two or more bodies performing some action at the same time in coordination is called
Synchronization
.
Synchronization can be observed in a wide variety of systems, from the flight of birds to the dancing people in a concert, to the operation of a network of computers. Therefore understanding this single phenomenon can give us an insight into a range of completely unrelated systems — making it a fascinating field of study (broadly, nonlinear dynamics).
One of our researchers, Dr Kaustubh Manchanda, works in the general area of nonlinear dynamics. Below is the summary of their recently published work [1] on the synchronization of oscillators in a network, in the author’s words:
In this work, we consider a star shaped graph (see Fig. 1). The node sitting in the center (
h
) is called a hub and here it is connected to eight edges: hence its degree of connectivity is eight. The nodes labelled (
p
) are called peripheral nodes. It’s evident from the figure that each one of them has degree of connectivity as one. Examples of star networks can be drawn from technological systems. For instance, the design of the star network comes from the telecommunication system, where the central switching station manages all calls. Star network is ubiquitous in computer networking. In a local area network (
LAN
), all nodes (workstations or other devices) are directly connected to a common central computer (hub). One disadvantage of a star network is that when the hub fails, the whole system can become non-functional.
Fig 1. A Star Network with omega hand omega p denoting the frequencies of the hub (central node) and peripheral nodes respectively. Figure reproduced with permission from [1]
On each of these nodes, we place a Kuramoto oscillator [2]. Simply put, a Kuramoto oscillator is an oscillator which has one degree of freedom namely its phase. These oscillators are commonly used in models of chemical oscillations as well as in the areas of neuroscience. Each oscillator has an intrinsic frequency. (
ω
h
: hub,
ω
p
: peripheral). The peripheral nodes interact with each other via the hub, this can be likened to a situation where several pendula are connected to the same beam and their interactions are mediated via the vibrations of the molecules of the beam. In our work, we assume a positive degree-frequency correlation which means nodes which have a higher degree (in our case it’s the hub), the oscillator placed on the hub has a higher intrinsic frequency as compared to the peripheral oscillators. This assumption aligns with commonly found star networks around us. The typical number of oscillators that we connected was 60. Another important thing to consider on such networks is the speed at which information travels between nodes, a realistic scenario is finite speed of propagation leading to time delay in this network.
The question we address in this work is about the onset of coherence or synchronization in this network of oscillators. We are interested in computing the threshold as well the route to synchrony, namely how the different oscillators organize themselves into the state of coherence. Our main finding was that the onset of synchronization via remote synchrony [3] occurred through continuous (first-order) and discontinuous (second order) phase transitions depending on the value of delay. For the positive degree-frequency correlated star network of phase oscillators, the time period of the system induced by average frequency is given by
T
a
v
=
π
ω
p
. Delays in the first half of the time period give continuous first-order phase transitions. In contrast, delays in the second half of the time period give discontinuous second-order phase transitions. At the critical point, the system undergoes a saddle node bifurcation.
Knowing how synchronization arises in the coupled dynamical system gives us the insight into the mechanisms to obtain desirable behaviour and control undesirable dynamics. A star network of phase oscillators is a simple and essential system for understanding the onset of synchronization dynamics. Such coherent dynamics is crucial to understanding how coupled dynamical systems regulate dynamics optimally.

An informal introduction to spin and kets
Subatomic particles have an intrinsic property that is quite strange to us. Called
spin
, this property has the dimensions of angular momentum. It is a rather strange name because the word spin does
not
imply that the particle is spinning on its own axis. All we
can
know is that it’s a type of angular momentum and it is different from the orbital and spin angular momenta we associate with bigger objects like the earth or the wheel of a moving bicycle. Spin is as fundamental as mass to subatomic particles and there is no macroscopic analogue to it.
Spin is a vector. Like any other vector, we can express it with components along
x
,
y
, and
z
directions. If we label the spin vector with
S
, then,
S
= S
x
i
+ S
y
j
+ S
z
k
, where S
x
, S
y
, and S
z
are the
x
−
,
y
−
, and
z
−
components. Curiously, it’s useful to describe the spin by a vector that resides in what is called the
Hilbert space
. Though abstract, such vectors are found to be quite handy in understanding the world of atoms.
Despite being so exotic, spin is something that can be measured in a lab. For example, you can measure the maginitude of the spin of an electron by sending a bunch of neutral silver atoms through a strong magnetic field with a sharp gradient. You can use silver atoms as a proxy for electrons because the spin angular momentum of a silver atom is effectively due to that of a single electron.
Silver atoms, though electrically neutral, possess a magnetic moment and hence experience deflection in a magnetic field. You expect the silver atoms to be deflected over a wide range of angles because that’s what happens to bigger magnets that we play with. You can compute the magnitude of the spin angular momentum of silver atoms, and hence that of electrons, by measuring their deflection.
Pretend that you have a system that sets up a magnetic field, send silver atoms through it, measure the deflection, and calculate and display value of spin angular momentum. Your job is just to switch on the system, and set the direction of the magnetic field. Just keep in mind that the direction of magnetic field determines the component of spin you measure: if you set up the magnetic field in
z
−
direction, you measure S
z
and so on.
Let’s say that you start the machine and set up the magnetic field in the
z
direction. You send one elctron at a time and note down the value of S
z
for each electron. You will soon find out that the silver atoms are deflected in only two directions, but not by a multitude of angles like the magnets. The values of S
z
corresponding to these angles of deflection are
+
ℏ
/
2
and
−
ℏ
/
2
.
After 100 silver atoms, you find that these two values are more or less evenly distributed; that is,
about
50 silver atoms have
+
ℏ
/
2
, and the rest have
−
ℏ
/
2
. You repeat the experiment for about 10,000 silver atoms, and the story doesn’t change: their S
z
values are either
+
ℏ
/
2
or
−
ℏ
/
2
, and the values are
more or less
evenly distributed.
Let’s pretend that you somehow are able to collect the silver atoms after they exit the magnetic field and put them into different boxes based on the magnitude of their spin angular momentum. So, you have a box with silver atoms with S
z
=
+
ℏ
/
2
and another with S
z
=
−
ℏ
/
2
. On the box containing silver atoms with spin
+
ℏ
/
2
(call it Box 1), you write ‘
+
z
’. You write ‘
+
’ because all the silver atoms inside have a positive value of spin, and ‘
z
’ to indicate the direction of the magnetic field you had set up. Similarly, on the box having silver atoms with spin
−
ℏ
/
2
(call it Box 2), you write ‘
−
z
’. You don’t write the actual value of spin because the numeral part is same for all the silver atoms; what changes is the sign.
All the silver atoms in Box 1 have the same spin value, and as far as spin is concerned, they are in the same state. Let’s label this spin state
|
+
z
⟩
, where the ‘
+
’ and ‘
z
’ have the meanings explained earlier. The symbols ‘
|
’ and ‘
⟩
’ indicate that
|
+
z
⟩
is a
ket
— a type of vector that exists in what is called the Hilbert space. Kets, along with a few other constructs, form the foundation of
matrix mechanics
— a refreshingly different and elegant approach to quantum mechanics.
Kets are abstract vectors, but the information they provide is concrete. If someone tells you that electron is in state
|
+
z
⟩
, what they mean is this: if you measure the spin angular momentum of the electron, say, by setting up a strong magnetic field in
z
−
direction, you get S
z
=
+
ℏ
/
2
. Similalry, an electron whose spin state is described by the ket
|
−
x
⟩
has S
x
=
−
ℏ
/
2
. Of course, to measure S
x
, you would have to set up the magnetic field in
x
−
direction. In general, labels like
|
+
z
⟩
and
|
−
x
⟩
convey two things: the direction of magnetic field, and the value one would obtain upon measurement.
Kets we have encountered so far provide clear information only about the state of the intrinsic spin angular momentum of the electron. They do not say anything about other important physical properties like the position, linear momentum, and orbital angular momentum of the electron. However, a more comprehensive description of the particle should involve the spatial part of the wave function describing position, linear momentum and so on.
Suppose you have a box full of silver atoms with their spin in state
|
−
x
⟩
. Out of curiosity, you decide to measure the value of S
z
for each of them. The spins of all silver atoms are in the same state, all of them pass through the same magnetic field, and you naturally expect them to be have the same value of S
z
. You have a surprise again: you notice that
about
half of them have S
z
=
+
ℏ
/
2
and the rest S
z
=
−
ℏ
/
2
. In other words, when we measure S
z
of silver atoms in state
|
−
x
⟩
, about half of them end up in state
|
+
z
⟩
, and the rest in
|
−
z
⟩
. We can capture the results of this experiment in a single equation:
|
−
x
⟩
=
1
2
|
+
z
⟩
−
1
2
|
−
z
⟩
(
1
)
The above equation is loaded with information. The
LHS
is a label for an ensemble of silver atoms with S
x
=
−
ℏ
/
2
. That means, if you take an ensemble of silver atoms in state |
−
x
⟩
, and measure their spin angular momentum by setting up a magnetic field in {x-} direction, then you would get
−
ℏ
/
2
. The kets |
+
z
⟩
and |
−
z
⟩
— called the
basis states
— are the states in which the silver atoms will be found after passing through the magnetic field. The |probability that a silver atom will be found in state |
+
z
⟩
(or |
−
z
⟩
) is:
|
1
2
|
2
=
0.5
(
2
)
In general, the probability that a silver atom will be found in state
|
+
z
⟩
is given by the square of the absolute value of the coefficient of
|
+
z
⟩
. Similarly, the square of the absolute value of the coefficient of
|
−
z
⟩
gives the probability that a silver atom will be found in state
|
−
z
⟩
. For the state described in first of the above two equations, the chances of finding the silver atom in states
|
+
z
⟩
and
|
−
z
⟩
are same because those states have the same magnitude of the coefficient. However, we can never say with certainty that a given silver atom will end up in state
|
+
z
⟩
(or
|
−
z
⟩
).
This ambiguity is indeed startling. If you have 100 silver atoms, and measure their masses under identical conditions, you
will
obtain the same value for each of them. You do not find that 52 (say) silver atoms have one mass and the rest have another mass. However, if you have 100 silver atoms in the same spin state, and measure their spin angular momentum under exactly same conditions, you do not get the same value. Why is it like this? Frankly, there is no answer to this question. All we can say is:
​
“
This is how nature works at the subatomic level.” More importantly, such observations show us that we can’t try to understand the subatomic world based on our experience gained in the macroscopic world.
We can interpret states like those expressed in eqn. (1) to be made of two other states
|
+
z
⟩
and
|
−
z
⟩
. Such states, called
superposition states
, are real and can even be prepared in a lab. In fact, they are the building blocks of quantum computers and people have figured more than one way of preparing them. Surprisingly, quantum systems exist in superposition states only until they are observed, and collapse to one of the basis states upon observation.
Expressions like that in eqn. (1) beautifully capture the randomness that defines the subatomic world and accurately predict the statistical outcome of a large number of identical experiments. However, they fail to predict whether a given silver atom will end up in state
|
+
z
⟩
or
|
−
z
⟩
! This is true not only for a simple system that is captured by eqn. (1), but for all quantum mechanics. This is not a bug, but a feature because it accounts for the fact that the subatomic world is inherently random and quantum mechanics captures it remarkably well.

No Raining on the Astro Club’s Parade
Proteep Mallik
and his former student,
Shravya Shenoy
, BSc in Physics (2016 – 19) look back at the origin of the university’s stargazing tradition and how far it’s come.
The summer of 2024 was a hot one, even in Bengaluru, which usually receives respite in the form of March and April rains. A side-effect of the missing showers was an unprecedented series of cloudless nights. For the stargazing community of Azim Premji University, this was good news.
​
“
We got an unbroken three-and-a-half to four months of crystal clear skies. It was so clear that we had no trouble finding some very faint objects and star clusters,” says Proteep Mallik, who has led stargazing sessions at the university since 2015.
The university’s stargazing journey is tied to Proteep’s own. Despite being an expert in optics and having visited large telescopes around the world, Proteep had not manually operated a telescope by himself until he joined the university as a physics faculty member. But when his colleague
Kripa Gowrishankar
donated her 4‑inch telescope to the university, he was tempted to give it a go. Once he got the hang of it, he began inviting his students to join him on his trips to the rooftop with the telescope. These were among the first batches of physics students at the university. One of them was Shravya Shenoy, who is currently pursuing a PhD in astrophysics.
A passion for stargazing has influenced not just Shravya’s life, but also her former classmate Siddharth, who is also currently pursuing a PhD in the field. Today, the university has several telescopes including an 8‑inch one that was purchased in 2017 precisely to encourage the burgeoning astro culture on campus.
“
It was a small little telescope, you know, and this was in the old campus which was basically two buildings separated by a lawn,” Shravya reminisces. Very soon, the word spread and they were joined by students across disciplines and also other faculty members. Besides giving Shravya and the other students their first opportunities to handle a telescope, the stargazing nights ended up being a fun exercise in community-building.

As far as Proteep was concerned, getting students to look at the sky itself was a victory.
​
“
The telescope is immaterial. If you just get into the habit of going to the roof of a building for an unobstructed view of the sky, you will see the moon, and quickly learn to identify planets. And if you spend a few hours observing the sky regularly for a few months, you will notice patterns of change due to the Earth’s rotation around the sun. These are things we read about in textbooks but it’s really cool to actually see it.”
The last season was particularly special for him to witness as an educator.
​
“
Many students came to observe the night sky every Tuesday from January to April. To do this, and be able to see how things have changed over the period, is eye-opening. They began to realise by themselves that Orion was setting earlier than before and by the end of the semester, they made sure to point the telescope at it in the beginning, knowing it would set soon.”
Developing this kind of intuition is extremely relevant to astronomers who have to be very strategic while requesting observation time in large multinational telescopes. For example, if one wants to observe objects in the Orion constellation, they need to know when is the best time for this.
​
“
To watch students come to this realisation on their own was quite wondrous,” says Proteep.

One of Shravya’s most memorable stargazing nights at the university did not even involve a telescope.
​
“
The Perseids meteor shower was expected one night, so about 15 or 20 of us brought out our yoga mats and blankets and just laid down on the lawn,” she says.
She vividly remembers the adrenaline rush that accompanied a sighting.
​
“
It took a while for all our eyes to get adjusted to the sky. When just one or two people shouted, we thought it could be a placebo effect, but since many of us shouted at the same time, we knew it must have been a real thing!”
The success of the stargazing nights was followed by the formation of the Physics and Astronomy club, one of whose activities was to invite scientists from the outside for talks at the university. It was during one such event that Shravya got to meet Jayant Murthy, a senior professor at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (
IIA
), Bengaluru.
​
“
I distinctly remember my classmates Siddharth, Anumita and I were standing near the sports field with Professor Murthy when he told us,
​
‘
You should build your own telescope’,” says Shravya.
​
“
For some reason, my brain just stuck with that idea.”
So when it was time for Shravya to decide on an honour’s project, she presented Proteep with the idea of building a radio telescope. Unlike optical telescopes which collect visible light waves, radio telescopes collect radio waves emitted by astronomical objects in the sky. Since radio wave receivers were easily accessible in the form of
TV
dish antennae, she believed – and Proteep agreed – that this was a viable project.

extremely manual telescope’

Admittedly, it turned out to be a lot harder than they expected, but the process of giving it a go itself was hugely rewarding for student and teacher.
​
“
I was lucky enough to go to a summer school for radio astronomy in Gauribidanur, Karnataka. And I think that was the point when I realised I liked working at an observatory,” she muses.
Six years later, Shravya finds herself doing exactly that. At the time of this interview, she was in the middle of a stint as support astronomer at the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes, La Palma, Spain. That means that when a visiting scientist comes to use the telescope, Shravya shows them how to set it up, change the filters and point it to the right direction.
The 2.5‑metre optical Isaac Newton Telescope is rather historic, having started operations in the
UK
in 1967 and later moved to La Palma for better viewing conditions. It’s one of the last remaining manual telescopes, so that’s why it’s crucial to have skilled handlers like Shravya around.
Incidentally, the Isaac Newton Telescope was decommissioned in June. In fact, Shravya had just witnessed its final days of operation.
​
“
It’s a very spooky building,” she says, having just returned after spending two whole nights at the observatory.
​
“
The architecture is old and sometimes when you close one door, the wind causes another one to open,” she laughs.
Overall, the young astronomer is content with how far she has come.
​
“
It’s quite a journey to come from stargazing with a small telescope in the backyard of the university to actually being able to operate this massive one,” says Shravya.
For her PhD research, Shravya works with radio telescopes to study galaxy evolution.
​
“
We try to probe galaxies which are very far away or way back in time with radio data,” she elaborates. Looking at the same region can reveal completely different things depending on the kind of telescope used.
​
“
For example, with optical, you can directly see how many stars are forming, whereas with radio, you see more of the black holes at the centre of galaxies, and the beautiful jets they emit.”

A passion for stargazing has influenced not just Shravya’s life, but also her former classmate Siddharth, who is also currently pursuing a PhD in the field. Today, the university has several telescopes including an 8‑inch one that was purchased in 2017 precisely to encourage the burgeoning astro culture on campus. Since then, Proteep has guided many more students through projects in astronomy and instrumentation at the university.
Thanks to this strong culture of stargazing, new batches of astro enthusiasts arrive on the terrace every year, eager to see specific comets or a supernova they read about. It’s this enthusiasm that has kept Proteep motivated over so many years. The upcoming winter-spring will mark the tenth season of stargazing at the university, and it’s safe to say that Proteep Mallik will not be free on Tuesday night!

Introduction to Physics
II
Scope, tools and ideas
Facilitator
Jayanth Vyasanakere
This is the more theoretical part of the introduction to physics course. It is designed as a transition between the higher secondary (plus two) approach to physics and our own programme. The 11
th
and 12
th
standards emphasise skills and memory and cover a lot of material, somewhat superficially. Our first goal is therefore to strengthen the habits and approach that the students will need in the remaining five semesters, to become more rounded physicists.
Our experience is that many students need to go beyond plugging in numbers into formulae, and start to think more in terms of physical principles. The process of learning a topic and applying what one has learnt calls for attention to concepts as well as details. The presentation, both written and oral, needs due attention to numbers, units, scales on graphs, and proper use of terminology. All these are conveyed in the context of examples taken from the natural world, and the world of technology.
The aim is not to cover a large amount of material but to enhance the students’ interest in physics and prepare them with the tools and techniques needed to appreciate, learn, and apply physics during the rest of the programme.
Focus is on themes rather than concepts in isolation.

Understanding Breakthrough Science Series
Disentangling the quantum revolution
Jayanth Vyasanakere
and
Murthy
OVSN
help make sense of the hype around quantum computation by highlighting the tumultuous and spooky past of quantum mechanics.
This year, two of the biggest science prizes in the world, the Nobel Prizes and the Breakthrough Prizes, went to researchers in the field of quantum science.
Alain Aspect, John F Clauser and Anton Zeilinger
shared
the
Nobel Prize in Physics
for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science, while
Charles H Bennett, Gilles Brassard, David Deutsch and Peter Shor
,
won
the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics
for pioneering the field of quantum information.
Jayanth Vyasanakere
and
Murthy
OVSN
, physicists from Azim Premji University, combined their knowledge and expertise to break it all down for us.
“
It’s funny because though neither of us has actually worked in quantum computation, Jayanth’s area—
superconductors
—is where many of the results in quantum computation have so far come from, whereas my area—
semiconductors
—is one of the promising candidates for scaling up quantum computers,” pointed out Murthy, as we settled into a fascinating discussion.
Let’s start with quantum mechanics. Why did the need for it arise?
Murthy
: Newton, and the people around at the time, gave us a very nice theory that could explain the motion of objects in the classical world, that is the world that we can see around us, and even extending to planets, stars and galaxies. For example,
​
“
what happens if you drop a ball” can be explained using classical theory.
But people noticed that atomic or subatomic particles did not follow the same kind of laws. There were similar issues with light as well. So, we had particles that behaved like waves, and light, which physics tells us is a wave, was behaving like particles. We needed a theory that could explain all of this consistently, and
quantum mechanics
does this.
It offers a description that works for particles, for light, and even for things like
​
“
spin”— which is not actually spin the way we think of it. Nobody knows what exactly we mean by the
​
“
spin” of the electron, but we
are
able to work with it [thanks to quantum mechanics].

So, we had particles that behaved like waves, and light, which physics tells us is a wave, was behaving like particles. We needed a theory that could explain all of this consistently, and quantum mechanics does this.
Murthy OVSN
What does quantum mechanics actually tell us?
Jayanth
: In classical mechanics, the aim is to get the position of the particle as a function of time. If you are able to specify the position, you’re done. Whereas in quantum mechanics, we can get the wave function at any given time; you’re not specifying that this particle will be found
here
. Already, some kind of ambiguity has come in the way we are describing the world.
So what can I do with this wave function? I can talk about the probability of finding the particle at this location, or that location. We cannot describe the precise location of the particle.
So quantum mechanics doesn’t give us an exact answer about the position of a particle. Is that a weakness of the theory?
Jayanth
: That was the question. Is it our ignorance? This is what the
​
‘
realist school of thought’ believed. According to this, the fact that we are only able to give a probabilistic or statistical description of the location of a particle is only our ignorance. There is a more detailed theory of mechanics yet to be uncovered, which would probably tell us precisely where the particle would be found. The realists said that quantum mechanics is some kind of approximate science.
But there was another position called the
​
‘
orthodox position’ or the Copenhagen interpretation. According to this, it’s not our ignorance — quantum mechanics is doing whatever can be done best. It’s just that the position of the particle never existed before we actually tried to make a measurement. The act of measurement forced the particle to take a stand.
This was the debate. Einstein led the realist position, whereas Niels Bohr and others led the orthodox position.
An article headline regarding the Einstein – Podolsky – Rosen (
EPR
) paradox paper, in the 4 May 1935 issue of The New York Times:

It’s important to note that it’s not that Einstein disbelieved quantum mechanics, it’s just that he took a position saying there is a more complete theory yet to be unearthed.
However, the majority, I would say, took a third stand — the agnostic view. These people said
​
‘
okay, while the rest of you discuss the conceptual foundations of quantum mechanics, we will go ahead with the calculations’.
They said that there was no point in debating whether the particle really had a position before the measurement. Because how do we verify if something was there before the measurement? All you can do is measure and see what is there now, not what was there before. So these people believed that this question can never be settled.
Can you elaborate on the realist vs orthodox schools of thought?
Jayanth:
Let me use an example motivated by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen’s 1935 argument. Consider the decay of a neutral pion (a subatomic particle). It decays into an electron and a positron. The conservation of angular momentum tells us that if the electron has spin
​
“
up”, the positron has to have spin
​
“
down”, and vice-versa. The question is which among these two combinations will actually occur.
Quantum mechanics predicts that the state of the system is
​
“
up down minus down up”, or
non-committal
. This means that whether this particle has spin-up or spin-down is undecided. All that can be said is that if you’re going to make a measurement of the electron and it turns out to be spin-down, then the positron has to have spin-up.
Suppose you make a measurement on the electron and you find that it has spin-down, a realist would say that the electron always had spin-down. That’s why the measurement showed so. Whereas, the orthodox position would say that there was no spin assigned to the electron until the time of measurement.
It was the measurement that forced the electron to take this spin-down state. And the positron becomes spin-up. Conversely, if the electron happened to be spin-up, the positron will immediately be forced to take the spin-down state.
Einstein said that for the orthodox position to be true, something that is happening here has to influence something at some distance away, and this influence happens instantaneously. This influence at a distance is problematic… spooky. This came to be called
​
“
spooky action at a distance.
”
Because we have something that is travelling at a speed faster than light — and this is against relativity, which by 1935 was a well-established theory.
It’s not that Einstein disbelieved quantum mechanics, it’s just that he took a position saying there is a more complete theory yet to be unearthed.

Jayanth Vyasanakere
How did the quantum debate eventually get settled?
Jayanth:
In 1964, John Bell made a breakthrough. He assumed that there was a more complete theory as Einstein suggested. This complete theory involved some
​
“
hidden variables”, that were yet to be understood. Based on this, Bell came up with some inequalities.
Mathematically, inequality is something that is less than something or bounded by something. Bell showed that if there did exist a more complete theory than quantum mechanics (i.e., the realist position), then this set of inequalities would need to be satisfied.
Bell’s inequality was independent of the nature of the hidden variable, so this eliminated the agnostic position. Remember the agnostic position said that the question of what existed before measuring could never be answered, but Bell’s inequality showed that it could.
The realist versus orthodox debate could be settled through experimentation, after all. If the experiment obeyed Bell’s inequalities, the realists would be correct (and also, quantum mechanics would require modifications). If it did not, then the orthodox school would be correct.
Here is an illustration depicting the difference between the realist position (hidden variable) and the orthodox position (quantum mechanics):
Source:
Nobel​prize​.org
There is a machine that throws out balls of opposite colours (or spin) in opposite directions. When Bob catches a ball and sees that it is black (or spin-up), he immediately knows that Alice has caught a white one (spin-down).
In a theory that uses hidden variables (realist), the balls had always contained hidden information about what colour (spin) to show. However, quantum mechanics (orthodox) says that the balls were grey (no spin) until someone looked at them, when one randomly turned white (spin-down) and the other black (spin-up).
Bell inequalities show that there are experiments that can differentiate between these cases. Such experiments have proven that quantum mechanics’ description is correct.
So who did the experiments and what was the verdict?
Jayanth:
John Clauser, and later Alain Aspect, designed some fantastic experiments — not with spin, but with photons. They measured the polarisation of photons and their correlations and showed that Bell’s inequalities were violated. This means that there is no (local) hidden variable. This proved that the orthodox position was indeed correct.
But if spooky action is real, does that mean that relativity is being violated?
Jayanth:
Einstein had earlier objected that if something happening here instantaneously impacts something at a distance, then a violation of relativity was taking place. However, it turns out that this is not a violation.
The main intent of relativity is that no causal signal can travel faster than light. A causal signal is something that actually carries information. In this case, whether the electron is spin-up or spin-down is completely probabilistic, and we cannot force the state of the positron by
​
“
deciding” what the state of the electron should be. That’s why spooky action is not actually a violation of relativity.
How do we go from quantum mechanics to teleportation?
Murthy:
This state of
​
‘
up down minus down up’, where the two states of — say, a positron and electron — are correlated to each other, is called entanglement. This phenomenon of entanglement was utilised to come up with the scheme of teleporting.
This means that a state in one place can be transferred to another place. Technologically, these teleported states are useful — for example, you can have very strong encryption or cryptographic schemes that cannot be broken. This is not like the Star Wars kind of teleportation, but the teleportation of quantum states.
Many agree that John Bell was responsible for kicking off the quantum revolution with his set of inequalities.

Can you break down for us the discoveries that won Alain Aspect, John F Clauser, and Anton Zeilinger their Nobel Prize in Physics in 2022?
Jayanth:
The foundations of this quantum mechanics are still being debated. And this Nobel, to some extent, is about people who have tried to settle the debate.
Clauser was the one who first came up with experiments to check Bell’s inequalities. He decisively showed that Bell’s inequalities were violated. Aspect was the one who removed certain loopholes in these experiments.
To be precise, the orientation of the detectors was quasi-randomised, so that the orientation didn’t influence the state of the particles, to begin with. Zeilinger won the prize for his experiments on quantum teleportation.
Quantum algorithms use features of quantum mechanics like a superposition of states, entanglement and measurement to solve problems that conventional computers cannot.
Not just computers of today, but even futuristic conventional classical computers, because the classical computers use the digital bit, which is either zero or one. But quantum mechanics uses a
​
“
qubit”, which can take a continuum of values [between two states].
Murthy OVSN
There is a lot of hype about quantum computers. What is special about them?
Murthy:
Current classical computers are really fast. They can outperform humans in things like chess, or mathematical problems. They can solve these problems very fast. But these are things that we also can do.
There are still
mathematical problems that are not within the reach of classical computers.
To give you an example, let’s take this lore of the chess board. When the King offered the inventor of chess to name his award, the inventor asked him for grain. How much grain? He asked the king to place a single grain on the first square of the chess board, and then double it for each subsequent square until all 64 squares were filled. The king happily said yes, but soon realised that this would drain all the grain! This is kind of representational of the kind of speed-up that quantum computers can give us.
Quantum algorithms use features of quantum mechanics like a superposition of states, entanglement and measurement to solve problems that conventional computers cannot. Not just computers of today, but even futuristic conventional classical computers because the classical computers use the digital bit, which is either zero or one. But quantum mechanics uses a
​
“
qubit”, which can take a continuum of values [between two states].
A qubit is a quantity that you can encode using quantum mechanics, and encode in particles that obey quantum mechanics. You can design algorithms to do these very clever things.
The wheat and chessboard problem

If a chessboard were to have wheat placed upon each square such that one grain were placed on the first square, two on the second, four on the third, and so on, the total number of grains would be eighteen quintillions, four hundred forty-six quadrillion, seven hundred nine million, five hundred fifty-one thousand, six hundred and fifteen, which is over 2,000 times the annual world production of wheat.
How long do we have to wait to get ourselves a quantum computer?
Murthy:
You’re not going to have a quantum computer in your pocket anytime soon! That’s out of the question.
One of the major challenges in quantum computation is that of scaling
. Right now, we are working with a few qubits. The most that I know of is only six, but we need to scale them to numbers like 2048 qubits. It’s not easy to maintain and monitor such large coherent quantum states.
There have been developments in error correction to overcome noise issues, but we are still some way off from having a quantum computer in our hands. Some, in fact, even say that it may not be possible to maintain such a superposition for a long time or monitor so many variables. They are highly sceptical of this whole quantum technology.
Can you break down for us the work of Charles H Bennett, Gilles Brassard, David Deutsch, and Peter Shor, who won the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics this year for pioneering the field of quantum information?
Murthy:
It’s interesting that while the Nobel Prize committee gave away prizes honouring the work that tried to settle the conceptual foundations of quantum mechanics, the Breakthrough Prizes were awarded for the technological revolution that we hope to see using quantum mechanics.
For instance, Peter Shor developed a fantastic factorisation algorithm that uses entanglement that uses measurement trickery to factorise large numbers in highly sped-up times. This kind of factorization can break the cryptography that we depend on for everyday banking and e‑commerce.
On the other side,
the very fact that you cannot copy a quantum state can be utilised to have a cryptographic protocol
that will be stronger than any conventional protocol that you can think of. Conventional bits, like digital data, can be copied endlessly. Quantum mechanical states cannot be copied.
In 1984, Bennett and Brassard came up with one of the first quantum mechanical protocols for cryptography — incidentally, that protocol was announced at a conference here in Bengaluru!
So, while Bennett and Brassard strengthened cryptography quantum mechanically, Peter Shor demonstrated that classical cryptography can be broken easily.
David Deutsch, the other Breakthrough Prize winner, won it for his description of what could be called a universal quantum computer. Now, that is a mathematical formalism to describe quantum computers, in a similar way that we think of Alan Turing with his universal computing ideas.
Turing came up with a mathematical idealisation of what a computer should be, and [classical] computers of today or even tomorrow would be dependent on those ideas. So, Deutsch’s ideas on the universal quantum computer are similar to that.

Shweta Ramdas
,
get together to discuss the new Artificial Intelligence system that can predict the structure of proteins, and its potential relevance to their own work.
This year’s Breakthrough Prizes, sometimes dubbed the
​
‘
Oscars of science’, were announced on September 22. With a reward of
USD
3 million each, these are currently the most lucrative science prize in the world, topping even the Nobel Prizes! This time, eleven researchers were recognised for their discoveries in fundamental physics, life sciences and mathematics.
Demis Hassabis
and
John Jumper
shared a prize for developing
AlphaFold
, an Artificial Intelligence (
AI
) system which accurately predicts the structure of proteins, one of the foremost challenges in biology today.
​
“
Everything in life is run by proteins — from enzymes to drugs to pathogen proteins,” said Ananya Mukherjee, biologist and faculty member at Azim Premji University.
While it is now easy to figure out the chain of amino acids that constitute any given protein, it’s more difficult to predict how this chain folds.
​
“
A single protein can take way more shapes than can be tested, but somehow inside the cell, the protein knows it must take one particular shape and that’s when it can perform its function. So far, we don’t know what rules govern the way a protein folds,” said Shweta Ramdas, a biologist and faculty member at Azim Premji University, summarising the
protein structure prediction problem
.
“
It’s all out there. I looked up my favourite proteins and I could vote if I think this is a good structure or not. This is great. Not only can we use the technique, but we can also give our feedback. This is exactly what open science is about, right?”
Ananya Mukherjee
Researchers led by Hassabis and Jumper made a breakthrough with
a machine learning-based system
they developed called AlphaFold. AlphaFold recently published the structures of 200 million proteins, that’s nearly every known protein from across the tree of life! As remarkable as this feat itself is the fact that all this information has been made available to the public for free.
Ananya, an experimental biologist studying algal photosynthesis, appreciated this aspect of AlphaFold:
​
“
It’s all out there. I looked up my favourite proteins and I could vote if I think this is a good structure or not. This is great. Not only can we use the technique, but we can also give our feedback. This is exactly what open science is about, right?”
The value of possessing knowledge of a protein’s
3D
structure is well demonstrated in recent history, with applications ranging from drug discovery to antibiotic resistance, from synthetic biology to crop resilience. Shweta pointed out the most pertinent example of the
COVID-19
virus.
“
The discovery of the structure of the virus’s spike protein allowed us to understand how it can recognise and bind to a human cell. This allows us to target it,” she said. Ananya added that there was also a group of scientists using
protein folding prediction to find plastic-degrading enzymes from the ocean
.
​
“
There’s so much that protein folding can tell us,” she stressed.
“
Are these crystal structures truly reflective of what is going on inside the cell? Proteins actually look different in the cell. Many function in groups, or they may pair up with a metal ion. Predicting the structure of these complexes is even harder.”
So, does AlphaFold mark the end of the protein structure prediction problem in science? Not really. Shweta reminded us that being a computational system, there are limitations.
​
“
It’s very good at predicting new protein structures based on what we already know about existing crystal structures. So,
your
predictions are only as good as the crystal structures are
,” she explained.
There was also something else to consider:
​
“
Are these crystal structures truly reflective of what is going on inside the cell? Proteins actually look different in the cell. Many function in groups, or they may pair up with a metal ion. Predicting the structure of these complexes is even harder.”
Nevertheless, both the experimental and computational biologists are excited about the potential ways in which AlphaFold can bolster their own areas of research. Ananya’s research explores the possibility of transferring specific algal proteins into food crops to improve their efficiency of photosynthesis.
​
“
The more we know about these proteins, their X‑ray crystallography structure
&
their predicted structures, we will be able to see which ones make sense to mutate and transfer to higher plants,” she said.
Being a computational biologist working on human genetics, Shweta is keen to make the most of AlphaFold for her projects.
​
“
We have
DNA
from individuals who have a certain developmental disorder, and we found mutations in a particular gene in these individuals — mutations that have never been found before. We want to predict what these mutations do and if they are causing the disease. Feeding these mutations into AlphaFold can help us answer this.”

Understanding Breakthrough Science Series
Phase transitions: The magic and physics of a living cell
A physicist (
Kripa Gowrishankar
) and a biologist (
Sravanti Uppaluri
) help us understand a fundamental discovery that has brought on a new paradigm of thinking about how cells organise themselves.
This year’s Breakthrough Prizes, sometimes dubbed the
​
‘
Oscars of science’, were announced on September 22. With a reward of
USD
3 million each, these are currently the most lucrative science prize in the world, topping even the Nobel Prizes! This time, eleven researchers were recognised for their discoveries in fundamental physics, life sciences and mathematics.
Clifford P Brangwynne
and
Anthony A Hyman
shared a prize for discovering a new mechanism of cellular organisation. Until this discovery, the dominant presumption was that most cellular activities take place in membrane-bound cellular subunits called
organelles.
However, Brangwynne and Hyman’s research revealed the widespread presence of liquid-like droplets or
​
‘
phase separations’
which act as temporary mini-reactors where many important biomolecular reactions routinely take place.
Having worked with Clifford Brangwynne during her postdoctoral research, Sravanti Uppaluri is no stranger to the immense potential of the discovery of these droplets. The biologist and faculty member at Azim Premji University explained,
​
“
Just like oil and water, when proteins and
RNA
molecules come together, they form a separate phase which can serve as another compartment where reactions take place. These phase separations can be a lot more dynamic as they can quickly disassemble and assemble as needed.”

Sravanti Uppaluri
Sravanti added that the discovery of these phase transitions has brought on a new paradigm of thinking about how cells organise themselves. This is clear from the number of studies that have since revealed these cellular droplets’ role in crucial processes like gene regulation as well as in debilitating diseases like
Alzheimer’s disease
. They have also been shown to have a role in deactivating viruses, even the
COVID-19
virus.
The Hyman-Brangwynne discovery stands out from most other biological phenomena because of the way it has captured the imaginations of physicists just as much as that of biologists.
“
We are used to thinking of cells as something that belongs to the domain of biology. But anyone can look at the cell and recognise how wonderful it is and try to explain what is going on inside it,” said Kripa Gowrishankar, physicist and faculty member at the university.
Kripa, who studied phase separations on the cell membrane during her PhD, pointed out that
phase transitions and phase separations
have been a traditional topic of study in physics for a long time, typically in the context of intermolecular interactions in mixtures, for example of water and oil.
​
“
Physicists are used to doing these kinds of experiments in a controlled lab environment. It’s very different when this happens inside a cell. It’s an amazing thing for anyone to study.”
“

Kripa Gowrishankar
Both Sravanti and Kripa imagine a future where understanding these mechanisms inside the cell could inspire applications outside the cell too, such as in the field of
synthetic biology
.
​
“
You could create some sort of catalytic mechanisms or centres for the production of some chemicals that are needed,” mused Kripa.
“
The possibilities seem endless,” said Sravanti.
​
“
The fact that there has been so much work just in the last 10 – 12 years is a reflection of the fact that so many disciplines are coming together. So many new experimental techniques have come up to probe and manipulate this phenomenon inside and outside the cell — this has been exciting!”
Kripa added,
​
“
Using all practical considerations, a cell shouldn’t be working at all! The fact that life works and we are living… can’t be magic, right? There has to be some physics behind it. The fact that it is doing this stuff at such a small scale, regulating the formation and disintegration of organelles… it’s quite lovely.”

Translations Initiative
Our initiative to plug lacunae in the higher education domain with learning materials for users from different backgrounds
A very serious concern in the Indian higher education scenario is that there is a paucity of high quality learning material at the graduate and postgraduate levels in Indian languages.
Millions of students do not have access to good material, losing out on learning opportunities. In our work with diverse students from different parts of the country, we decided to launch a large-scale translations initiative.
To do our part to bridge this serious gap, we work on translating academic reading and pedagogic material into different languages. We create these translations for the use of teachers and educators in higher education programmes, with a focus on Kannada and Hindi for now.
We plug serious gaps in the higher education sector by translating learning materials into Indian languages.
Translating academic readings at the Master’s Level
It is our work to build a movement to make available quality graduate, post graduate level texts and readings in Indian languages in different disciplines. A primary part of our work involves translating academic readings and book chapters for Master’s programmes in the fields of development and education.
Anuvada Sampada, Azim Premji University’s Translations Repository
Anuvada Sampada
, a free, open-access online repository of academic resources in Indian languages, to support students and teachers to engage more deeply with concepts and ideas
Reading materials for higher education in Indian languages is a dire need felt by students, faculty, and institutions across the country. Non-availability of such reading materials in Indian languages that can help students engage with modern ideas in their own languages and are relevant to their contexts is a major constraint in expanding access to education and ensuring inclusion.
The availability of concepts and nuanced debates in regional languages would enable the exchange and development of ideas in diverse contexts. Access to foundational, conceptual materials that lay down the basic perspective and structure in regional languages, would also facilitate students to eventually contribute to the discourse in these and other languages.
The generation of knowledge that is useful to the community and which the community is a part of can only be accomplished when regional languages are the medium of higher education. Though this need for producing materials and offering courses in higher education in regional languages has always been felt, not much headway has been made towards it.
With this purpose in view, Azim Premji University initiated the translation of higher educational materials from English to regional languages, to make these openly and freely accessible to a larger set of students belonging to diverse socioeconomic backgrounds in India.
This one-of-its-kind initiative was begun with the belief that the availability of quality materials in Indian languages will support students to engage more deeply and thoroughly with content, concepts and ideas currently available only in English.
The translation efforts are currently being carried out in Hindi and Kannada with a view to build discourses in these Indian languages. The University is obtaining appropriate copyright permissions to increase the number of open access documents on the site.
Objectives
Anuvada Sampada, the Translations Repository, has been created with the following objectives:
Make high-quality academic material in sciences, social science, humanities and languages available and accessible in Hindi and Kannada to all.
Enable wider dissemination of academic materials in Hindi and Kannada.
Enable university/​college students, academics and practitioners to mine, use, and reuse academic materials in Hindi and Kannada.

KathaVana: Annual Bilingual Children’s Literature Festival
Translations Initiative
University-School Connect Programme
KathaVana: Annual Bilingual Children’s Literature Festival
An exciting collective journey of promoting children’s literature
KathaVana is an annual bilingual children’s literature festival hosted by Azim Premji University since 2012 with active involvement from
Field institutes
across Karnataka.
It believes that children’s literature — oral, performative and written — has the capacity to welcome children into the world of pleasure, imagination, emotions, creativity, curiosity, different cultures, play with language, empathy with human lives, and an understanding of self.
A few key questions motivate KathaVana:
Can young children be introduced in meaningful ways to literature?
Can teachers be introduced to (and convinced about) its power and relevance to the lives of their young students?
Can this be accomplished in the context of government schools?
Can we produce useful materials — children’s books, teacher resources — to support teachers’ use of literature in the school context?
Based on these questions, each edition of KathaVana offers a variety of forums where children, teachers and community members can engage deeply with literature— through book exhibitions, storytelling and read aloud events, puppet shows, meet-the-author and illustrator sessions, professional development workshops for teachers, and forums for different kinds of stakeholders to come together and discuss pertinent issues related to literature.
Each edition of KathaVana takes up a theme and explores issues related to that theme more closely.
The theme for the 13
th
edition — Kathavana 2025 is Enabling Children to Write Through Creative Activities

Teacher Professional Development
Undergraduate Programmes
Mathematical Methods in Physics 1
Experimental Foundations: Perform experiments that were significant milestones in the development of physics.
Facilitator
Jayanth Vyasanakere
Studies in Physics and other quantitative and analytical disciplines rely strongly on the tools of differential and integral calculus. This course is a prerequisite for the Physics courses that require calculus for a complete understanding and are taught at the university from the second semester onwards.
Though calculus is covered in some detail in plus 2 maths, it is taught in a way that encourages students to regurgitate procedures of solving calculus problems in a mechanical way. After an introduction to vectors, linear algebra and series and sequences, this course gives students a real feel for the principles behind calculus and its applications to problems in physics, biology, economics etc. Important theorems in calculus are introduced and applied to solve problems in an intuitive way.

Biography
Mohan completed his doctoral degree from Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore Centre. He has earlier taught in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham’s Bengaluru campus and was a field associate at Azim Premji Foundation’s Puducherry District Institute.
His doctoral work was on Cohn-Leavitt path algebras of bi-separated graphs, which builds a common framework for Leavitt path algebras and their various generalisations. He also studied their non-stable K‑theory and representation theory in a few special cases.
In recent years, étale groupoids have become a focal point in several areas of mathematics. The convolution algebras arising from étale groupoids, considered both in analytical setting (groupoid C* algebras pioneered by Renault) and algebraic setting (Steinberg algebras). They include many deep and important examples such as graph C* algebras and Leavitt path algebras, and allow systematic treatment of them.
On the other hand, partial symmetries arising in dynamical systems can be realised by étale groupoids via inverse semigroups. This has led to a fertile confluence of different areas of mathematics such as non-commutative algebras, inverse semigroup theory, and C* algebras. His research interests are focused on the study of how these areas interact with each other. He is also interested in undergraduate mathematics education and communication.
He is the multi-media editor at
Bhavana, the mathematics magazine
, and runs
Math Nomad
, a YouTube channel. He enjoys long walks, and listening to music, audiobooks and podcasts.

Biography
Ramanujam obtained his PhD from Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (
TIFR
), Mumbai. He was a postdoctoral fellow at City University of New York (
CUNY
),
USA
, and then joined The Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSc), Chennai where he was a faculty member for more than three decades until he superannuated in July 2021.
His doctoral work in the 1980s was in the area of logic programming. Along with Rohit Parikh (
CUNY
), he was among the early researchers to study epistemic logic to reason about distributed systems.
In the 1990s, he contributed to developing partial order models of concurrency and local temporal and epistemic logics over them. Since 2000, he has worked on the verification of cryptographic protocols, automata theory and logical foundations of game theory, definability in first-order theories of graph orderings, and decidable fragments of first-order modal logic.
Ramanujam is on the Editorial boards of
ACM
Transactions on Computational Logic
and
Journal of Philosophical Logic.
He is currently the Chief Editor of the
ACM
Minigraphs series. He is also Chairperson of the
Commission on Logic Education
of
IUHPST
/
DLMPST
, a
UNESCO
division.
Ramanujam has been associated with Tamil Nadu Science Forum (
TNSF
), a voluntary group of science communicators, and is the Editor of
Thulir
, a monthly children’s science magazine in Tamil.
He was a member of the Steering Committee of the National Curriculum Framework 2005 (
NCF
2005), and chaired the National Focus Group for Teaching Mathematics. He is a member of the committee set up by Government of Tamil Nadu to formulate the state’s education policy.
In 2020, he was awarded the Indira Gandhi Prize for science popularisation by Indian National Science Academy (

Introduction to Algorithms
This course is intended to give undergraduate students of mathematics an introduction to algorithmic reasoning.
Facilitator
Ramanujam R
This course is a level one elective offered to third year mathematics students and students from other majors. Mathematics students in the third year would have already been introduced to programming and numerical methods, in which they have developed some computational skills but have not thought deeply about algorithms. This course will help students learn the basics of algorithmic thinking and connect it to mathematics and computation. This elective will help students interested in doing masters in mathematics/​data science and will help education students understand the link between computation, algorithm and mathematics learning and teaching.
The students gets to focus on the notion of algorithm and to understand what it means to view mathematical problems through an algorithmic lens. This involves analysis of computational methods to determine their correctness and efficiency, to compare different methods systematically and to design optimal algorithms.
The course is introductory in nature, giving the students a basic understanding of the
design and analysis of algorithms (rather than mastery of the subject), and offering a glimpse of algorithms in mathematical domains such as number theory, algebra, geometry and graph theory. As an elective in the final semester of the BSc Mathematics programme, the course provides the student an opportunity to revisit mathematical problems through a new lens.

Linear Algebra
The plane is thought to be two-dimensional, experienced space as three-dimensional and represent them by coordinate systems. This course leads to vector spaces and linear maps which crop up everywhere in mathematics.
Facilitators
Divakaran D
Mohan R
Ramanujam R
Programmes
BSc in Mathematics
BSc BEd (Upto 2024)
This course is principally a study of solutions to systems of linear equations, vector spaces and linear transformations. Linear maps are among the most useful tools in many contexts within mathematics as well as its applications. The study of linear algebra gives a geometric intuition into the algebraic structure of solving systems of linear equations, along with a strong computational underpinning.
While the student gets familiar with matrix algebra, calculating determinants and eigenvalues, seeing matrices as linear transformations gives insight into the structure of abstract vector spaces and their invariant subspaces from a geometric viewpoint. Basis and dimension lead us to abstract coordinate systems, inner products help us define notions of distance and orthogonality, projecting vectors into subspaces and decomposing vectors into components. Existence of eigenvalues is inferred from algebraic properties.
While the student gets comfortable with the concrete family ℝ
n
, examples of vector spaces such as that of polynomials of bounded degree, or that of continuous real-valued functions over closed intervals show wide-ranging applications of geometric concepts such as norm and distance, preparing for applications as well as more advanced mathematical study.

Biography
Divakaran is passionate about teaching, especially at the undergraduate level. He strives to build effective pedagogy and relationships with students.
His research interests are in geometry, topology and its applications. He has broadly worked on three areas – metric geometry and its application to geometric topology (during my PhD from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore), the structure of the space of functions between products of Riemann surfaces (during post-doctoral fellowship at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences(IMSc), Chennai), and evaluation and construction of samples for Monte-Carlo integration (during post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Edinburgh).
Currently, he is working on embeddings of Riemann surface laminations (this work builds on his work during post-doctoral fellowship at
IISER
Bhopal). He is also exploring geometric group theory and hyperbolic geometry.
In addition, he is also a hobbyist blogger. He blogs in Malayalam in his personal blog Manorajyam (
https://​www​.manora​jyam​.com
). He has another film blog in English called 2

Programmes
BSc in Mathematics
BSc BEd (Upto 2024)
This is the second part of a two-course introduction to mathematical explorations, that lays the foundation for all the mathematics courses that follow, and is also taught through Inquiry-Based Learning (
IBL
).
The course provides the student the required transition from an intuitive understanding of the infinite to its axiomatic treatment. The student gets to see the role of formalism in providing a safe scaffolding to avoid erroneous inferences. This course provides an introduction to logic and the need for formalisation in logic, as well as practice in reading and writing formal proofs. Ordered sets and sequences are used to provide a rich landscape as content for assertions where students see the need for proof, and try their hand at providing rigorous arguments. Sequences on discrete as well as continuous domains provide examples for such arguments, and set up a foundation for algebra and analysis.

Tulsi Srinivasan

Programmes
BSc in Mathematics
BSc BEd (Upto 2024)
This is the first part of a two-course introduction to mathematical explorations that lays the foundation for all the mathematics courses that follow. These two courses are taught using Inquiry-Based Learning (
IBL
): there are no lectures, there is no
​
“
covering” material in a textbook; instead students work together solving problems from carefully structured worksheets, and discuss, discover and raise questions.
In school, students do not get an opportunity to
​
‘
do mathematics’. Further, there is a sharp discontinuity between school mathematics and university mathematics in content. Students learn about notions like isometries, rigid transformations, and linear transformations, through algebraic, geometric, and computational explorations.
This course attempts to fill this lacuna by both allowing students to experience the process of doing and creating mathematics. It is structured so that students explore new ideas and themes, make guesses, come up with new structures and terms, and then prove their results. The topics are chosen from concrete linear algebra, providing continuity between school mathematics and university mathematics, by providing an entry to abstract spaces after building a foundation on concrete structures. The course activities involve significant exercises in reading and writing mathematics in a graded fashion. Students learn about notions like bases, dimension, linear transformations and orthogonality, through algebraic, geometric, and computational explorations.

Nature of Mathematics
A study of the structure of mathematics as a discipline and its processes
Facilitator
Ramanujam R
Mathematics is abstract and yet widely applicable. What are the unifying ideas and techniques that make mathematics an effective language and tool? What are the processes that constitute mathematical activity? How are concepts and abstractions layered on top of each other giving mathematics its structure? How does the notion of proof provide rigour to mathematical arguments? We provide a glimpse of mathematics as a discipline, providing a historical and conceptual overview.

We begin with rings and fields to see how familiar properties of the integers can be extended to polynomial rings, and then to other rings and fields, before moving to groups. You will learn the definition of rings and fields at the same time as you will see the construction of various number systems and the ordered field structure of the real line in Calculus 2, and study vector spaces over the reals in Linear Algebra.

A course on multivariable calculus for a further study in a large number of mathematical areas.
Facilitators
Mohan R
Shantha Bhushan
Tulsi Srinivasan
For this course, you will bring your understanding of linear algebra and real analysis. This course introduces you to different notions of differentiability and integrability for functions of several variables, and the geometric interpretation of these concepts. It also explores some deep and ubiquitous results like the Inverse Function Theorem, and the theorems of Green, Gauss and Stokes.
This is essential for further study in a large number of areas in maths, like differential equations and mathematical modelling, differential geometry, and statistics. The course is also important for students who are considering postgraduate studies in physics or economics.

, starts a five-year sabbatical (well, kind of) in October this year. Not only does he get half a decade off teaching and administrative work, but he will also receive nearly 1 million Euros to spend during this time.
Is he about to embark upon some daring expedition? In a way. Buzzard is about to translate Andrew Wiles’ famous proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem into a form that is legible, and therefore verifiable, by computers. According to one
commentator
on the platform Reddit,
​
“
This will either be a big waste of money or something amazing.”
Mohan R
, who teaches mathematics at Azim Premji University, would place his bets on
​
‘
something amazing’, but he does have some concerns, too.
Nandita Jayaraj
sat down for a conversation with him to find out more.
Nandita:
So, Kevin Buzzard has set out to use a software called Lean to verify the 129-page proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem. This is not to suggest that there is any question about the validity of Wiles’ proof; mathematicians (human ones) have already confirmed this. However, if Buzzard is successful, it means that Lean has the potential to become a valuable tool in the arsenal that will take us to a world where machines can do maths. At least that is what some mathematicians and computer scientists say.
Mohan:
I would divide us mathematicians into three groups — and I have met at least one example from all these groups!
The very, very optimistic — ones who believe that
AI
will take the field to a new level. I am among them.
Those who see
AI
as a negative thing — as they believe mathematics is, and should be, a human endeavour.
A large group — who are taking a neutral stance; they are aware of the new developments in terms of implications of
AI
in mathematical research, in particular about Lean, Coq, and other proof assistants, but they are taking a backseat for now. They want to wait and watch how
AI
shapes the landscape.
Nandita:
It is not just Kevin Buzzard who is using Lean. It was also recently used by a group of star mathematicians (including Terrence Tao) to verify their proof of an intriguing conjecture proposed by Hungarian mathematician Katalin Marton in the 1990s. While trying to figure out what exactly Lean is, I realised that it cannot prove theorems itself. It is more of an autocorrect mechanism if I understand correctly.
Mohan
: It is important to first realise that Lean itself is not
AI
. It is one of the many computer tools that can help mathematicians with their proofs. After humans write a proof, we want to ensure that all the steps are correct. Computers can do this now, and a tool that does this is a proof verifier.
On the other hand, while writing the proof, I may get stuck, or I may end up spending too much time trying to manipulate some mathematical expressions. Computers can help here too. They can suggest what to do next or simplify something. In this case, I am using the tool as a proof assistant.
So, which one is Lean — a verifier or an assistant? Being relatively new to Lean, I spoke about it with my colleague
Divakaran
who uses it more often, and he said it was somewhere in between.
Lean
was named among
Quanta magazine’s
​
“
Biggest Breakthroughs in Math and Computer Science
” in 2020. Since then, mathematicians have faced ups and downs in their quest to maximise the tool’s potential.

Youtube/​Quanta Magazine
Nandita
: It is interesting that despite there being several other tools, Lean is the one making the most news…
Mohan
: Actually, tools like Coq and Isabelle were popular proof verifiers even before Lean came about. I know that Coq was used to formalise (convert to computer code) all school
geometry
. There have been instances of a large group of mathematicians using various proof verifiers to formalise lengthy proofs of important theorems, such as the
Feit-Thompson odd-order theorem
and
Kepler’s conjecture
.
Close to home, IISc mathematician Siddhartha Gadgil
used
the programming language Scala to improve a proof as part of the popular Polymath project back in 2018. These programs were built by mathematicians and educators, a small community without much support, unlike Lean, which has Microsoft as a parent
Having such strong backing means that Lean’s library is huge and can be accessed by anyone. Many high-profile people are using it and teaching others how to use it. I think the reason Lean is in the limelight is not just because it is being used by mathematicians, but because it is being used by mathematicians who are popular communicators too.
Nandita
: We are not yet at a time where machines can turn into mathematicians. But there are signs that we are getting there.
Google’s Deepmind laboratory recently made two big announcements:
An
AI
programme AlphaGeometry, which
according to them
​
“
solves complex geometry problems at a level approaching a human Olympiad gold-medalist”; and
Google’s
AI
tool FunSearch had come up with
a new solution
to the cap set problem, famous in the field of combinatorics.
Computer scientist Yuhuai
​
“
Tony” Wu,
has said
that he sees a future with an
​
“
automated mathematician” that has
​
“
the capability of solving a mathematical theorem all by itself”. Proponents of Lean, including creator Leonardo de Moura
say
that the software has the potential to tackle the challenges in the way of generative artificial intelligence (
AI
) becoming a reality in mathematics.
Mohan
: It may happen, but there is still some way to go. If we are talking about creating a computer programme that is as good as a research mathematician, then as Timothy Gowers says, we need anywhere from 10 to infinite years!
To use Lean, you need to be able to formalise mathematical statements. A statement that may seem simple to us, such as
​
‘
the sum of any even numbers will always be even’ will not be understood by a computer as it is. We even have to explain to it what we mean by an
​
‘
even’ number. This process of translation is called formalisation.
As of now, learning Lean is a very steep learning curve. It reminds me of when the typesetting system ​​LaTeX was introduced. In its early years, it was very difficult for people to use. But over time, it became much more usable and we all picked it up. Today, LaTeX is standard for all mathematicians to use. Lean is not yet at that level.
Prominent mathematicians Siddhartha Gadgil, Terrence Tao and Kevin Buzzard have been part of the discourse on
AI
in mathematics.

I imagine that 10 – 15 years in the future we may have a ChatGPT interface where a student can write a proof which would be auto-converted into code that could be fed into Lean or any other tool. The computer will be able to tell them if their reasoning is perfect, and whether there are any gaps. They would not require a teacher every time. This could solidify their understanding of how to do mathematics.
Mohan R
Nandita
: But this didn’t stop Kevin Buzzard from starting the Xena Project in 2017, right? He seems to believe that you can teach undergraduate students how to use Lean and formalise mathematics in their curriculum. Other mathematicians, like Athina Thoma and Paola Iannone, are exploring if tools like Lean can change the way undergraduates think about proof. As an undergraduate maths teacher in India, you must have some ideas about the use of
AI
in the classroom.
Mohan
: Kevin Buzzard’s primary aim was to create a library where lots of basic results are already available in Lean. Unless this foundation is built, every time we try to formalise higher mathematics, we will have to spend our time formalising the basic statements within it. Buzzard sensed that for Lean to fulfil its potential, undergraduate-level mathematics would need to be formalised. He thought learning Lean could be integrated with the undergraduate first-year course called
​
‘
How to Write Proofs’. But after teaching the course, he realised that it was not going to be easy.
Interested students were indeed willing to be trained, but it was much harder to do it on a larger scale. When learning to write proof itself is a big skill, trying to learn Lean parallelly was not a good idea. Many students were not finding it useful. This will change in the future if Lean becomes a lot simpler to learn, and if developers come up with programmes that can read proofs that are human-written and convert them into Lean code.
Nandita
: A way to automate the formalisation process…
Mohan
: Yeah. That is what I think will be coming next.
Nandita
: This past year,
AI
has become part of the vocabulary of the urban upper-middle class and ChatGPT has a lot to do with it. I am aware that academic communities are abuzz with debates on how to tackle its
misuse
by students.
Mohan
: If you ask it to write you an essay, ChatGPT certainly can, but as far as I understand none of the Generative Pre-training Transformers (GPT
s
) are very efficient in solving even basic arithmetic. That said, maths teachers may have problems when the capabilities of these tools improve. But I think this too can be a positive thing.
For example, I see students struggle to understand what a proof means, what makes an argument sound. Teachers should give each student personal feedback, but this is impossible if I am teaching a class of 100 students.
I imagine that 10 – 15 years in the future we may have a ChatGPT interface where a student can write a proof which would be auto-converted into code that could be fed into Lean or any other tool. The computer will be able to tell them if their reasoning is perfect, and whether there are any gaps. They would not require a teacher every time. This could solidify their understanding of how to do mathematics.
Would they at some point be able to ask the tool to create a proof for them? Probably, but in my opinion, this won’t take them very far. Computers have limitations. You have to tell them what and how to think, give them the right prompts. And that requires a lot of effort.

“
If only people who know
AI
get the jobs, then mathematics will turn exclusionary. However, we can begin working on such issues by integrating
AI
tools into the curricular experiences of mathematics teaching and preparing students for new jobs that will be created.”
Mohan R
Nandita
: What about the mushrooming concerns about
AI
taking away jobs? According to a 2023
report
by Microsoft, 74 percent of Indian workers are worried about this. Satya Nadella added fuel to the fire when he
warned
that displacement of human jobs was indeed to be expected.
Mohan
: A lot of people are now graduating with PhDs in mathematics, and already many of them struggle to get jobs. Until they can get a stable job, these young PhDs join institutes as Research Assistants (RA
s
). A primary job of these RA
s
is to verify the work of mathematicians.
For example, they are asked to check for gaps in a 20-page long proof and are promised a publication at the end. That is how it works today, but this scenario may completely be disrupted as
AI
gets more efficient. If my computer can do it, why would I hire a new
RA
? I may prefer to invest my funds to boost my computing power than to pay a human for the job. So emerging young maths PhDs will have to be top of the game to get a job.
Nandita
: That is scary. Although, it could be an opportunity for graduate students to get ahead of the curve and skill up, right? For example, a PhD student who is a seasoned formaliser and a user of Lean may now be a very attractive hire.
Mohan
: Certainly. But that is also something I am afraid of — that mathematics will become an elite game that demands that people not only have the right mindset but have also received the
​
“
right” training. If only people who know
AI
get the jobs, then mathematics will turn exclusionary.
However, we can begin working on such issues by integrating
AI
tools into the curricular experiences of mathematics teaching and preparing students for new jobs that will be created.

Graduating in a Subject vs Teaching a Subject
From being a theoretical linguist to an applied educational linguist,
Agniva Pal
shares his story.
From sitting in a class trying to understand Shakespeare to understanding the meaning of Saussurian signs and symbols to eventually standing in a class teaching how a student may capitalise on the knowledge offered by linguistics, I think I have come a long way.
As I crossed the billionth second in my life (Wade, 2018) and as the freckles on my forehead increased, I realised that I have started to treat my life experiences from a certain educational viewpoint. My life experiences were suddenly stories that could be narrated to groups of students while discussing something from the course document. There is a certain, subtle pedagogical advantage that I started getting when I started looking at things, especially experiences of life, facts and wisdom, conversations, stories and random WhatsApp messages claiming
​
‘
research claims’, through the eyes of a researcher. It add
s
to my role as a teacher.
I had previously taught design features by Charles F Hockett, which talks about universal features of language on planet Earth (Hockett’s Design Features, 2023). A few features are shared by all living organisms which can communicate and a chosen few belong to human beings, the evolved primate beings. I was not sure why these were being taught to students previously.
My parents were unpleasantly surprised when I chose to pursue humanities in my 10+2 and then went ahead and pursued a Bachelor’s degree in English Honours. The word which best describes the way I was educated in the literary arts is
​
‘
sheepish’. Little did I know that after 15 years, I would be teaching students how to capitalise on literature while teaching young kids and thereafter the role of literature in the lives of children (Eagleton, 1985).
Back when I was a student, we were mostly handed out notes and the only
​
‘
correct’ interpretation of a prose or poem would be the one which teachers would hand out to us, through their notes!
Only a few teachers inspired us to read literature the way it is supposed to be read and yet their roles were dissolved in the
​
‘
aquaregia’
(Aqua Regia, 2024) of acidic note-makers quickly.  I suppose this aversed me and many others.
Luckily, when we were introduced to an extremely rudimentary and old form of linguistics in our third and final year, it caught my attention. I realised the beauty of being able to interpret on my own, understanding the phonetic symbols and the way words form. In the end, my observable universe was affected by the principles of universal grammar (
Chomsky’s Universal Grammar
, 2024) and I decided to pursue linguistics in my Master’s.
Fast forward ten years and I had completed master’s, MPhil and PhD in Linguistics. I worked with right-hemisphere brain-damaged (
RHD
)  individuals. A person with
RHD
might manifest changes like problems of adherence to theme conversations, lack of facial expressions, either very quick or very slow speech, changes in the pitch of their voice or absence of pitch variations, frequent digressions and so on.  They are also characterised by neglect of the left side of the body, hemiplegia or hemiparesis  (Pal, 2018, Pal, 2019).
This was my first exposure to how linguistics can be used beyond just theory. This was where I learnt that phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics and every other field of linguistics may be used to understand the human brain. The language of an individual studied through phonetics also reveals their pitch variations and therefore messages encoded beyond just words in conversations.
For example, one may say,
​
“
Please come in”, to a student in a welcoming way and someone else may say the same with a disgusted face. In spite of the words being the same, the message can be drastically different.
After the PhD, I needed a job, and I realised that I would either need to be associated with English departments where I could teach a bit of linguistics or be associated with research concerns but not get to teach at all. Unfortunately, there was very little scope for continuing my research and hence, I gravitated towards teaching at some places in English departments.
Since my first job in teaching, I have given it my all and students loved the fact that the International Phonetic Alphabet could be understood and not memorised; that
morphemes
or the smallest units of grammar (for example, sing+ing makes singing.
​
‘
Sing’ is the free morpheme and
​
‘
ing’ is a bound morpheme since it cannot be used freely in a sentence) in a word may be broken down into free and bound versions and none of them needed to memorise examples for it. They would even be able to guess the
etymology
(Etymology, 2024) of a word to some extent. But somehow, I knew all of this was to pass an exam! I had the urge to use linguistics to make a difference.
Skip to February of 2023, and I had just joined the School of Education at Azim Premji University. There was so much to learn, and the excitement was real. Yet, I knew there was a lot to catch up. It was not before I sat in the classes that I realised how, the subject that I loved so much, linguistics, was playing a pivotal role.
From mindlessly teaching Chomsky (Noam Chomsky, 2024) to teaching Chomsky along with Krashen (Stephen Krashen, 2024), Piaget (Kendra Cherry, 2023) and Vygotsky (Kendra Cherry, 2023), to teach language acquisition and henceforth variations of language in a classroom, I have come a long way. I have come from being a theoretical linguist limited to teaching concepts of linguistics for simply answering an exam to being an educator who’s able to blend linguistics into the domain of education.
I didn’t realise that language plays a pivotal role in education. I have been teaching language planning and harping on the importance of planning and implementation and yet I did not realise tangible changes can be attained if language planning may be done properly, through proper discussions with experts who understand a target language and with policy experts. I did not realise policy plays a huge role in the way languages are looked at in a country or that in the absence of proper policy that supports a particular language, it might eventually fade into oblivion (Dewey, 1974).
It took me time to understand that the scheduled languages in the
VIII
schedule of the Indian constitution were the languages that gained political momentum. These were the languages with either rich people’s support or people strong enough to fend for themselves. At the end of the day, indigenous Adivasi minority languages aren’t there on the list because they don’t have enough social power and capital like Kannada or Tamil speakers do.
And hence I also realise that some languages will never gain a spot on the schedule. They will use their languages under the pressure and power of another language that has gained a spot on the schedule and die eventually never gaining a spot on the schedule. Their children will never be educated in their mother tongues. Their stories will not be told by their future generations and their languages will always be called a
​
‘
boli’, not a
​
‘
bhasha’ (Mesthrie, 2009). Recently, I also completed writing a paper narrating the same. I would never have looked at language and linguistic politics from this point of view, had it not been for the educators at the university or the kind of questions we want the students to ask and answer through the course of the 2‑year
MA
in Education
.
I had previously taught design features by Charles F Hockett, which talks about universal features of language on planet Earth (Hockett’s Design Features, 2023). A few features are shared by all living organisms which can communicate and a chosen few belong to human beings, the evolved primate beings. I was not sure why these were being taught to students previously.
Here, I connected the design features with the way languages have evolved throughout time and how acquisition of languages may take place in various humanoid groups, based on geographical location, association of sounds with symbols through mass recognition and the evolution of modern languages. A certain degree of scientific temper is slowly being ingrained into me, a type which urges me to question what a certain topic might add to the life of a student to make their life easier and where they may be able to use that sort of knowledge.
I realise now that it is also important for future teachers to be able to have a lot of capacity to deal with deviations from what they think is their linguistic normalcy. One might be speaking a phonologically different variety of the language that a teacher speaks and that does not mean it has lesser amounts of prestige (Agnihotri, 2009).
A student might also use words that might be loan words from their home language because they are desperately trying to grasp the new language through which they are being educated and as a teacher, one should be able to sustain all kinds of students in a classroom. A classroom needs to be an inclusive space where every student should feel equal. In the long run, this is what will bring sustenance to the education system. I practice it and want my students to as well.
Teaching research has also been a part of my teaching regimen throughout my stay at various organisations, but it was only when I started to teach field research that I understood what students might gain out of an engagement at the grassroots levels in the field.
It has been a rewarding process teaching them to understand the connection from
ontology to epistemology
, in turn guiding them to understand how to choose ideal methods to elicit empirical data. It was equally rewarding to see them elicit good data, work on it and then come up with full-fledged master’s research dissertations of their own. The fact that I was a researcher, researching not a long time back in the field, working with right hemisphere-damaged participants at a hospital for my PhD only helped me train these students better.
In short, my experience only helped me teach better. These were students who once questioned the importance of literature review. By the time the
Field Research I and
II
course
ended, these students knew the value of citation, the cons associated with plagiarising and the importance of questioning things, even commonplace in everyday life. They are the graduating batch and it was satisfying to see them develop an outlook of life that was quite different than what most of them had before the courses.
When I received a call from the People Function informing me that they thought my candidature would fit a role in the school of education, I was puzzled. At that time, I thought it would be another interview where I would not be able to understand the questions asked to me. I was taken aback when questions regarding linguistics were asked to me, well within my subject area and grasp. From a phase where I was questioning my possible worth in a school teaching education to teaching at the School of Education, Azim Premji University, where I have successfully inflicted students with perilous knowledge that I know will someday, be used by them on the field, I have come a long way.
From mindlessly teaching Chomsky (Noam Chomsky, 2024) to teaching Chomsky along with Krashen (Stephen Krashen, 2024), Piaget (Kendra Cherry, 2023) and Vygotsky (Kendra Cherry, 2023), to teach language acquisition and henceforth variations of language in a classroom, I have come a long way. I have come from being a theoretical linguist limited to teaching concepts of linguistics for simply answering an exam to being an educator who’s able to blend linguistics into the domain of education.
I have been able to use linguistics to support pedagogical practices in class and student betterment. A long-term goal would be to find discernable societal viewpoints and general traditions and practices but that will take time. I’ve also become a more tolerant version of myself! Frankly, I am glad that I came across this new linguistic perspective, in the first place.
I am glad that I get to have a hand in creating future educators, mentors, philosophers, social workers and thinkers who would value linguistic diversity, and cultural and traditional diversity, who can freely question practices that are commonly accepted in society, who can pinpoint problems through their research-oriented thinking and who will bring change to the society.
A classroom needs to be an inclusive space where every student should feel equal. In the long run, this is what will bring sustenance to the education system. I practice it and want my students to as well.
I am also happy that this allows me to bring changes to my life directly. They say that if you have an infinite number of monkeys (Infinite Monkey Theorem, 2024) typing random keys on an infinite number of typewriters, they will end up typing out all the works of Shakespeare, Tagore and every other great because one day they will randomly type out every right combination of keys exactly in the right order. I hope I am one of those monkeys, who ends up contributing to society!

Deliberative Democracy and the Need to Rethink the Education of a Free India
Amman Madan
bears a torch for a democracy in which freedom, citizen participation and respectful dialogue matter more than just numbers and angry rhetoric.
Many people have started asking for a deliberative democracy after seeing the problems that beset democracies around the world. What is this strange new
​
“
deliberative” democracy? Read on to find out!
Democracies have grown in numbers across the world over the last three centuries and appear to be the most widely accepted political system in the world. Democracy has definitely succeeded in reducing the role played by hereditary kings, with their arbitrary actions and erratic judgement. On the other hand, democracy has not quite led to the happy, wealthy and just societies which it had been expected to create. As the joke puts it, democracy is the worst possible form of government, except for all those others which have been tried.
Those who believe in a deliberative democracy, however, say that solution lies in deepening democracy, not giving it up. They say that the problem is in how we earlier used to imagine a democracy. The solution is in re-imagining it and in improving the processes of democracy. This is to be done by strengthening the processes of deliberation in social and political life.
Votes can be easily obtained by pandering to the lowest desires and thoughts of a populace. Politicians around the world promote selfish and irresponsible desires, incite hatred and polarise views and find that this pays off during elections. Legislative bodies too often take up a majoritarian form. The group with the largest number of seats pushes its views through, ignoring all other perspectives and positions. Those in opposition rage and fume and hurl increasingly frustrated invective against those in power. Democracies often appear to be more divided and chaotic than even kingships. Some are tempted by this to forget the crazy and selfish acts of real-life kings and dream again of the moral orderliness of a monarchy.
Those who believe in a deliberative democracy, however, say that solution lies in deepening democracy, not giving it up. They say that the problem is in how we earlier used to imagine a democracy. The solution is in re-imagining it and in improving the processes of democracy. This is to be done by strengthening the processes of deliberation in social and political life.
Earlier, there used to be two major approaches in democratic thought, both of which influenced India’s freedom struggle:
A protective democracy:
Democracy as a way of protecting people from the arbitrary actions of the rulers and the state. Democracy was seen in an instrumental way, as a political system which ensured that if a sufficiently large number of people were unhappy with a ruler, that ruler could be peacefully removed, without bloodshed or rioting of the kind we are currently seeing in Bangladesh. A new replacement would be installed, one who was more congenial to the wishes of  the people. This was the kind of position much favoured by British liberals like Jeremy Bentham, John Locke, etc.
A participatory democracy:
Participating in decision-making was good for people, it fulfilled them as human beings and led to more responsible actions. When people were denied political participation they were made passive and hopeless, thus taking away something vitally human in them. Democracy was seen as something which was intrinsically good for people. This was how many like Hannah Arendt, M.K. Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Karl Marx, John Stuart Mills and so on justified why the voice of the people mattered and why it should decide how we are ruled, or rather why we should rule ourselves.
The problem, deliberative democrats say, in both these positions is that they are only about putting forward one’s own views and demanding space for oneself. There is no great attention paid to how we build our views in the first place. Nor is attention paid to the others’ views, especially whether there may be anything worthwhile in them. Such positions lead to a majoritarian democracy, where whatever the government says is thought to be correct, so long as there are enough people willing to vote for it. The weakness of such a democracy is that numbers take up the place of truth and power replaces moral validity in deciding what should be done. If there are enough people willing to vote for a party that says we should close down government schools, that is what will get done.
On the other hand, if there are enough people to vote for a party that says we should close down private schools, that will get done. The process of deciding what to do is reduced to who has the greater numbers. Deliberative democrats say that such a system of democracy does not give enough importance to reason or evidence or a sense of equality and justice in taking decisions. They say that instead of believing that numbers make one right, one should pay attention to how one is coming to the conclusion that one is right. Too often parties and individuals say that whatever they think is right and is the final word and push with all their force to get it implemented by the state. Instead, they should deliberate and think and examine positions from all angles and then come to the reasoned conclusion that this or that should be done.
When institutions and processes emphasise only the sharp articulation of positions, they lead to the current state of affairs. When institutions and processes emphasise deliberation, dialogue and respect for other points of view, they will lead to an improved, enhanced democracy.
In a deliberative democracy the emphasis is thus not on the numbers that justify a position taken by an individual or group, but on deliberation, viz. thinking and discussing with each other to find the best way forward. This invites us to pay attention to the reasoning, evidence and values that can justify a position. It asks for processes that will help different interests and interest groups to put forward their arguments and to listen to other arguments and to weigh them. Legislative bodies should be a place for thinking together, exchanging arguments to come to a conclusion which is best for all the groups in the discussion. They should not be what they have become, sites for shouting matches, demonstrations or worse.
Claus Offe and Ulrich Preuss (1991) say that in a democracy we aim to take the wisest decisions, so there should be an emphasis on reason (not prejudice, ideology and ignorance), on far-sightedness (for example, don’t hand out compensation, but plant trees and regulate construction to stop landslides), and respect for others (not selfishness, bigotry and insularity). Those who understand the place of communities in our lives would add to this the importance of fraternity or
maitri
. Many value positions are created by experiences and traditions, which have community patterns and are not created by reason alone. A deliberative democracy therefore asks for empathy across social groups. This will permit us to listen to and accommodate other perspectives as well.
This may sound as idealistic today as democracy sounded in India at the time of the freedom struggle. Yet, as the freedom struggle has shown us, ideas can change the world. They do this by shaping institutions and processes. When institutions and processes emphasise only the sharp articulation of positions, they lead to the current state of affairs. When institutions and processes emphasise deliberation, dialogue and respect for other points of view, they will lead to an improved, enhanced democracy.
The notion of a deliberative democracy, which takes decisions on the basis of discussion and reflection,  asks us to rethink many things. It invites us to look again at our ideal of a good person and how good people act. It further asks us to reflect upon how that good person should act in public affairs. For this it says that our education system, especially civic education within it, needs to be drastically changed so that we build a deliberative rather than majoritarian democracy, with its emphasis on numbers alone.
An important step forward will be to build suitable cultures. The deliberative democracy will work only when people are supported in being thoughtful, sensitive and reflexive. The education system and public culture must play an important role in this. The current school curricula and our public culture of democracy talk largely about demanding what one thinks is right. They are in line largely with protective democracy by teaching how elections work and how governments function.
The participatory democracy too appears in our education system, with its high point being the
NCF-2005
and its calls for paying attention to marginalised voices. The deliberative democracy, however, is present only in fragments, a little here and a little there. Only occasionally do we hear someone putting forward reasoned arguments and being willing to listen to the arguments of others.
Every act of promoting deliberation, empathy and dialogue, wherever we get the opportunity to do so, will be a step towards a better world.
The proponents of a deliberative democracy would say that the political system and its institutions should change their functioning to foreground deliberation rather than just pressing one’s claims. School and college education and public culture will play an important role if this is to happen. Textbooks, ways of teaching and assessment that highlight deliberation and reasoning rather than finished answers will help in this. Young people will then learn to listen to others and to identify valid and invalid arguments. When they learn to recognise what is valid in moral arguments and sift the justifications from the chaff, they will be able to make better decisions. Curricula that promote respect for other social groups and points of view will lead young people to empathise with others. This will enable them to give a fair hearing to all perspectives, rather than just clinging fearfully on to their own. Learning how social conditions can create fair or unfair barriers, learning about how history can affect our perspectives and create biases, will help them to think in a clearer way.
A deliberative democracy may lead us forward from a democracy where people do not listen to each other and get increasingly frustrated at the other’s obtuseness. For this to happen we need to rethink school and university curricula. But we need not wait for that. Every act of promoting deliberation, empathy and dialogue, wherever we get the opportunity to do so, will be a step towards a better world.

Revisiting the Child Labour Debate on
​
‘
World Day Against Child Labour’
Vijitha Rajan
on the need to move the child-labour debate from scholarship to policy and practice.
In contemporary child rights discourse, the eradication of child labour has emerged as a key focus for global and national policy frameworks. While the call to eliminate child labour is often framed as an unquestionable moral imperative, particularly within rights-based and developmental discourse, scholars have pointed out that this framing has also been contested. This article revisits some of these contestations. It begins by briefly laying out the global policy discourse on child labour and the call for its elimination, followed by revisiting the critique by postcolonial scholars and finally, highlighting implications of these debates for the problem of child labour in the Indian context.
Article 32 of the
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
(
UNCRC
, 1989) affirms every child’s right to protection from economic exploitation and any form of labour that is hazardous, interferes with their education, or adversely impacts their wellbeing in physical, mental, or social terms. To ensure this, the Convention urges states to legislate and implement policies setting minimum employment ages, regulate work conditions, and enforce these provisions through appropriate sanctions.
The International Labour Organization (
ILO
) clarifies that children engaging in light, non-hazardous tasks that do not hinder their schooling or development such as helping with family enterprises or earning pocket money during holidays can benefit from such experiences, which help them acquire practical skills and prepare for adulthood (
ILO
, n.d.-a). By contrast, child labour refers
ILO
defines it as exploitative or harmful work that deprives children of their childhood, education, wellbeing, or dignity. This includes work that is dangerous or interferes with school attendance, and the nature and classification of such labour often vary by national context and industry. Furthermore, the
ILO
’s International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (
IPEC
) prioritises eradicating the worst forms of child labour as defined in the 1999
ILO
Convention. These include child slavery, trafficking, forced labour (especially in armed conflict), sexual exploitation, involvement in illegal activities like drug trafficking, and hazardous work environments that threaten children’s health, safety, or moral development (
ILO
, n.d.-b).
One major line of critique of the global policy framing of child labour stems from postcolonial theory. This perspective challenges the dominant humanitarian narrative that constructs childhood in the Global South as a condition of lack or deficiency in need of rescue. Nieuwenhuys (2013) argues that child rights campaigns, such as the call to eliminate child labour, often has colonial underpinnings of
​
‘
the white man’s burden
’ which in turn portray non-Western childhoods as incomplete or deprived. This discourse relies on the claim that Western childhoods are normative and desirable, while others are cast as primitive or needing civilising intervention. The language of
​
‘
stolen’ or
​
‘
lost’ childhoods, as seen in reports like
Stolen Childhoods by Save the Children (2017)
, reflects these problematic assumptions. The report ranks countries based on indicators such as health, education, and labour and categorises many African and South Asian nations as places where children are
​
‘
missing out on childhood’. Such classifications implicitly measure all childhoods against a Western ideal and ignore cultural and historical diversity. Such portrayals reflect a legacy of colonial discourse, where the poor non-Western child symbolises developmental failure, and where childhood is treated as a homogeneous ideal already achieved in the West and absent elsewhere (Balagopalan, 2011; Nieuwenhuys, 1998).
Rather than viewing childhood in the Global South as deficient, postcolonial scholars call for recognition of multiple modernities and localised understandings of childhood. They critique the assumption that modern childhood and associated rights frameworks are neutral, universal constructs. Nieuwenhuys (2013) emphasises that both children and colonised populations were historically imagined as vulnerable and incapable of self-governance. This imagination in turn legitimises interventionist policies in the name of progress. Elsewhere, Nieuwenhuys (1998) has critiqued how dominant child rights frameworks, particularly the
UNCRC
, promote a singular model of childhood, largely based on Northern ideals. These frameworks assume a standardised vision of a protected, school-going, economically dependent child, which becomes the normative benchmark for defining a proper childhood. This notion not only marginalises culturally diverse childhoods but also constructs Southern children as
​
‘
others’ who are presumed to be
​
‘
outside’ of childhood and in need of saving or civilising. Aid and development discourses further commodify these representations by marketing the Southern child as a symbol of lack and deficiency and reinforce colonial tropes of the West’s moral and developmental superiority. For instance, Sinervo and Chenai (2019) observe that advertisement campaigns by global agencies often featured emotionally charged images of brown, foreign-looking children looking distressed, accompanied by vague slogans like
​
‘
save children’s lives’ and
​
‘
do something’ or
​
‘
give something’. These messages, displayed in public spaces along with other commercial ads, offer no concrete explanation of the children’s circumstances or what exactly viewers are being urged to act upon.
The category of the child was fluidly defined based on the administrative needs of the state; and age and childhood were strategically mobilised to discipline bodies, reproduce labour, and maintain social hierarchies.
- Balagopalan (2014)
Balagopalan (2014) extends this critique by interrogating the liberal embrace of
​
‘
multiple childhoods’. While the concept challenges monolithic constructions of childhood and validates non-Western child-rearing practices, it also risks reifying cultural specificity in ways that isolate these lives from the broader workings of power, such as state policy, market forces, and global development agendas. The danger, Balagopalan argues, lies in the depoliticisation of cultural difference, where respect for diversity becomes a liberal act of tolerance that conceals underlying universalist assumptions. This framing casts children in the global South as inhabiting
​
‘
culturally rich but politically disconnected’ spaces — respected yet not emulated.
The prevailing binary that positions schooling as the natural antidote to child labour has come under critical scrutiny from scholars who question its historical and structural underpinnings. This dichotomy, particularly in postcolonial contexts like India, overlooks how modern schooling was historically complicit in managing and reproducing labouring childhoods under colonial rule (Balagopalan, 2014). Far from being a neutral, liberatory force, schooling was often aligned with the colonial state’s agenda to normalise child labour, especially for children from marginalised castes and classes. Balagopalan shows how the category of the child was fluidly defined based on the administrative needs of the state; and age and childhood were strategically mobilised to discipline bodies, reproduce labour, and maintain social hierarchies. Nieuwenhuys (1998) similarly has critiqued the romanticisation of schooling as a saviour and argues that formal education often delegitimises other forms of knowledge and labour. Furthermore, child labour is not merely a by-product of poverty, as mainstream policy narratives often suggest. Myron Weiner (1991) shows that in many societies, including colonial and postcolonial India, cultural attitudes and political decisions, rather than economic necessity, have shaped child labour policy. The belief that poor children should work to support their families is deeply entrenched and has even been endorsed by state actors. Thus, the assumption that the school is a natural solution to child labour is not only historically flawed but also ideologically fraught. Schooling is often presented as a quick-fix solution which in turn masks the structural inequalities and obscures how education itself is implicated in the reproduction of social hierarchies and labour regimes.
India’s legislative framework around child labour reflects a tension between protection, regulation, and differential aspirations for different childhoods.
The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act of 1986
marked a significant step by prohibiting children under 14 from working in hazardous occupations. The
2016 Amendment to the Act
introduced further measures to mitigate the problem. Yet, it still permits children below 14 to work in family enterprises after school hours or during holidays, and allows adolescents (14 – 18 years) to work in non-hazardous sectors. While this amendment ostensibly seeks to balance cultural and economic realities, critics argue it reopens the door to exploitation and undermines earlier protections and the global call to eradicate child labour (see The Hindu, 2016; Balagopalan, 2018).
Debates around child labour often remain confined to academic circles, marked by heated exchanges but with limited tangible impact on the lives of children who are actually labouring. It is crucial to ask what relevance do these discussions hold for them? There are important lessons to be learned. We must not delegitimise children’s lives simply because they do not conform to an idealised notion of childhood where labour is inherently seen as problematic.  At the same time, glorifying children’s labour and their cultural contexts can be equally troubling as it does not take into account larger structures of exclusions within which children’s lives are situated. It is high time these discussions move beyond scholarship into policy and practice. In the post-pandemic era, as social protections remain poor, livelihoods seem to have become increasingly precarious, and marginalised communities continue to face multiple exclusions across education, health, and employment, the question of child labour remains an urgent issue.
On this
World Day Against Child Labour
, let us be reminded that every child deserves a life of dignity and freedom and that this ultimate goal must not be lost in the rhetoric of the child labour debate.

Schooling in Crisis, Questioning Our Future
What happens to childhoods and schooling in conflict zones?
Saswati Paik
describes the catastrophic consequences.
War, war everywhere
Numerous regional conflicts and wars are happening across the world. Everyone talks about regional conflicts and wars. Media highlights several immediate aspects of the conflict like missile attacks, casualties and atrocities, the territories and numbers of military personnel captured. There are also reports of wider problems of civilians fleeing across geopolitical borders. But who talks about the schools in those conflict zones?
What is happening to these children? Many of them might have left the world along with their parents, many of them might have lost their parents and family members, and those who are alive are losing their childhood, learning from their contexts and surroundings — learning from visible elements like fighting with others for survival, damaging
​
“
others” for one’s survival.
After decades, when the present war zones calm down, we may take stock of human loss, property loss, economic loss, but who will take stock of the learning loss of the children? Who will evaluate what an entire generation of children witnessing horrible scenes of painful death, murder, attack, and bombing has learned during these years? Who will evaluate how these accidental learnings will impact the next generation of humans who experienced such trauma in their childhood? What will we do then? How will we repair this damage? Can we do that at all?
The young children, pre-teens and early teens, drew the police and army with guns. Many of them tried to show blood spots with red sketch pens, putting dots in red on white paper. They described their pictures later to our students stating that they have experienced these things in their childhood in their immediate surroundings. Many of them innocently stated that they would like to join the army and police to punish people who have killed their parents, relatives, and neighbours.
Disruption in schooling and childhood
Here are two scenarios here where schooling disruption is a common aspect.
Scenario 1:
A few years back, some of our students from Azim Premji University went to the red-corridor zone of Chhattisgarh, where schools run in very difficult circumstances, the schooling process is uncertain, children face disruption in schooling due to armed conflicts.
Our students asked the children of primary and upper primary schools to draw anything as per their choices on a piece of paper. The young children, pre-teens and early teens, drew the police and army with guns. Many of them tried to show blood spots with red sketch pens, putting dots in red on white paper. They described their pictures later to our students stating that they have experienced these things in their childhood in their immediate surroundings. Many of them innocently stated that they would like to join the army and police to punish people who have killed their parents, relatives, and neighbours.
Scenario 2:
I met a few girls in one of the residential schools in Chhattisgarh. Their native states were Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. They used to stay here despite having very basic knowledge of the language, Hindi, which was the medium of instruction in their school. Their parents were apparently migrant labourers; they couldn’t send their daughters to any school in their own localities because of similar armed conflicts. They got to know about these schools and managed to admit their children here. The girls were quite clueless, they were uncertain about their schooling, because these residential schools were mainly dependent on the decisions of the local government.
The surrounding area was full of army people, there was unknown tension and anxiety in the local environment. The teachers were all from outside this locality, they were not able to understand the language of the children enrolled in this school, and because of the uncertain situation in the locality, the teachers were keen to get a transfer from here.
According to the teachers, many such children, once they visit their home, never return to the school. No one knows where they go and whether they continue their schooling anywhere else.
We may ignore such scenarios because these are not directly impacting most of us, whose children are privileged enough to get all kinds of facilities for schooling. But can we completely deny these issues? Can we guarantee that our so-called privileged children with good schooling background will never encounter children from such places who have already nurtured lots of hatred and anger towards privileged people?

Schooling in armed conflict areas
“
Learning loss” is a popular topic of discussion post the pandemic when all nations started feeling the gap of learning due to unprecedented school closures during the pandemic. Such learning loss may lead to severe damage to the younger generation. However, human memories seem to be quite weak by nature. Either we forget about our crisis very quickly or we tend to ignore the crisis.
Therefore, we humans have invited many crises through zonal and national-level wars within two years of overcoming the pandemic crisis. During this period we did not pay much serious attention to the crisis of our generational catastrophe due to the learning gap of children across the world. Whatever resources could have been spent for reconstructing nations, are now being largely spent on our man-made conflicts.
Today’s children will be future citizens, administrators of different nations, flag bearers in different development sectors. What they learn today matters. What they will apply tomorrow, will matter too. Our learning from life affects the application of our knowledge, skills, belief systems, etc. We can easily imagine what a set of children, suffering from their necessities now, may act like in the future.
Hatred may give birth to more hatred, cruelty may lead to more cruelty, some belief systems may remain the same forever impacting the coming generations for many years.
Schools are not the only source of children’s learning. But schools play an important role in children’s holistic development in various ways. Schools are not only academic spaces, they are also hubs of socialisation for children. Children do not only learn from teachers, they learn from each other as well.
Any disruption in the schooling process due to natural or man-made hazards leads to disruption in children’s lives in numerous ways. Home schooling is a luxury for many such children and a conducive learning environment at home and surroundings is also a dream. When natural or man-made calamities disrupt human lives, children get more traumatised than adults irrespective of socio-economic status.
The scale and nature of trauma might be different for different classes and genders, but such trauma may surely lead to multiple challenges for many years. Are all the nations across the world ready to face those challenges?

Can we guarantee that our so-called privileged children with good schooling background will never encounter children from such places who have already nurtured lots of hatred and anger towards privileged people?
Who is a global citizen today?
Local issues have a ripple effect on our larger society. When so-called privileged children of today become adult citizens, the world of adult citizens will consist of people having disrupted childhood too. Then history will repeat, and this repetition might be extremely violent and destructive even beyond our imagination.
A research was conducted in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka between January and April 2001 that stated that
​
“
Conflict has its greatest impact on the poorest communities in the poorest countries, and children and adolescents under age 18 are among the most severely affected in these communities” (Boyden et al., 2002). Is that impact only in terms of the learning gap in formal education? No, it’s much beyond that – which we tend to ignore.
The biggest crises are yet to come, the spirals have just been visible through regional unrests. The silence of the global and national agencies is quite disturbing. The harmful thoughts and belief systems are spreading like a fire. We humans are all tiny animals with all kinds of animal instincts on this huge planet. We all fight mainly because of two aspects: resources and power. Other aspects are all revolving around these two. At this point, we are not different from other animals. They also fight for resources (mainly food) and the power to grab those resources.
Conflict has its greatest impact on the poorest communities in the poorest countries, and children and adolescents under age 18 are among the most severely affected in these communities.
- Boyden et al., 2002
We tried to make a difference in our human world through formal education. But the present situation across the world indicates that our formal education has limited our sense of citizenship; we are all now born with a sense of only local or regional citizenship.
The vision of global citizenship, ownership of and gratitude to the larger global community are largely deteriorating. It’s sad but indeed true that we, humans, are becoming insensitive to others, behaving with no sense of rationality. It’s a crisis of the entire human society where members are sheltered inside their regional shells with shells in their hands to destroy others.
Our next generation does not deserve such a terrifying world around them; they must get a chance to behave more responsibly as global citizens.
Who will ensure that and how? Our children are out of school, schools are either becoming shelters in the war zones or being destroyed because of war. Should we let our children get ready for the next generation’s wars and conflicts in this manner?

Lessons from L B Road, Chennai
R Ramanujam
shares some of his experiences from taking classes for child workers.
Learning a trade?
In Chennai in the 1990s, it was common to find boys like Babu, 14 years old, in petrol pumps. For 50 paise, or perhaps 1 rupee in some
​
“
expensive” pumps, the child would fill the tyres of your two wheeler or car, checking air pressure. Babu was usually singing the latest Ilaiyaraaja hit while he did the job. You could discuss recent films with him, as he was quite knowledgeable.
When asked whether he was willing to attend some classes in the evenings or during the weekend, Babu was visibly dismayed. At first he thought it was some
​
“
police action”, which was a broad term in his vocabulary including any state intervention. After I explained to him that it was not compulsory, and that it would be with the permission of his employer, he was less afraid but yet showed distaste at the prospect. Further conversation led to his emphatic assertion that school had been hell back home in his village in Tiruvannamalai district, and he had been glad when he got the opportunity to come to the
​
“
big city” and work.
I asked why he had hated school so much, and Babu laughed. What he revealed was a story of repeated failures in exams and beatings, both at home and in school.
“
But don’t you get beaten here also, by your employer?” I asked.
“
Oh yes, but I am learning a profession here. Am I not?” Babu asked me.
This was a refrain we kept hearing. Tamil Nadu Science Forum (
TNSF
), a voluntary group, was then organising efforts to put working children back in school. This was in 1993, closely following the total literacy campaigns in several districts in the state (and not yet taken up in the metropolis). Anyone involved in adult education would note the tremendous futility of such efforts while at the same time children were dropping out of schools, necessitating future adult education programmes.
However, action programmes for finding out-of-school children and putting them back into schools were difficult: a 13-year-old child who had been out of school for three or more years could not cope with the curriculum in Class 8.
TNSF
organised evening centres in Chennai where children could learn for a year, and after that we could enrol them in school, if not into the age appropriate class, at least some level below.
For a child like Babu whose memory of school was one of fear and failure, the prospect of another school experience was distasteful. This was something we were to see many times in the next few years. More on this later.
Doing Science experiments with children from the tannery was interesting. They approached phenomena in an open manner, uncoloured by textbooks and exams, offering whatever explanations they could come up with, thus in a genuine spirit of inquiry. For those of us conducting the classes, it was a valuable experience, communicating science simply, making up terms as we went along, rather than being bound by textbook language.
R Ramanujam
Experiments in Taramani
It was much easier to organise classes for children who were working in the tanneries along what is now the
​
“
information superhighway” of Chennai. The leather factories that dotted Old Mahabalipuram Road have given way to software companies. But in the early 1990s, many children, boys and girls — 8 to 16 years old — were working in the tanneries. One of my earliest evening classes for child workers was in the Taramani Corporation School for these children. Some students from
IIT
Madras helped in these classes as well.
Any content teaching was difficult. Children would come by 6 in the evening, having worked all day and were tired and sleepy within half an hour of sitting with books. Necessity forced us to abandon textbooks and use only songs, stories, games, experiments and hands-on activities, being content with whatever learning this led to.
Not schooled in any education theory, what we didn’t know was the role of experiential learning in pedagogy. The internet didn’t exist, and access to such material was difficult. Whatever material we could find from the
Hoshangabad Science Teaching Programme
(
HSTP
),
Arvind Gupta’s books
and other scanty material from the
People’s Science Movement
went into the mix. All this later contributed to a series of publications by
TNSF
and in turn, they had a major influence on material developed by (and for) Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan in Tamil Nadu nearly a decade later, especially in its Activity-Based Learning Programme.
Doing science experiments with these children was very interesting. Both boys and girls participated enthusiastically. These experiments were performed with low-cost / no-cost materials, largely relating to mechanics, some on optics and a few in chemistry. They approached phenomena in an open manner, uncoloured by textbooks and exams, offering whatever explanations they could come up with, thus in a genuine spirit of inquiry. For those of us conducting the classes, it was a valuable experience, communicating science simply, making up terms as we went along, rather than being bound by textbook language. These sessions led to articles later published in
Thulir
, the monthly science magazine in Tamil published by
TNSF
.
At that time, the focus was on putting these children back in school and ensuring that they would stay there, not drop out again. We achieved some success, in that 14 of our 26 children rejoined school a year later. We were then heartbroken that 12, principally among the older ones, could not. Only much later did we learn that success rates in back-to-school initiatives were rarely above half, indeed often less than one-third.
These classes continued for a few more years. The fact that
​
“
our children” struggled in the formal school but yet managed to pass, a few of them even doing well, was a strong positive outcome. Among those who did not rejoin school, one went on to complete schooling in the open schooling system, eventually obtaining her
SSLC
certificate.
If this was a
​
“
success story” of some sort to narrate, working with children like Babu was much harder. In terms of
​
“
outcomes” it was a failure, but the process was nevertheless rewarding, and worth speaking about.
No country for working children
Lattice Bridge (
LB
) road runs for roughly two kilometres, connecting Adyar and Thiruvanmiyur in Chennai. In 1994, alongside
LB
road there were three movie theatres, several small restaurants and a large number of shops, selling a variety of goods. Today, it’s a busy glittering road, with even more commercial activity, with a
​
“
cine-multiplex” replacing one of the old movie halls, and many upscale stores and restaurants. The big difference is that there are no children working in any of them now, whereas thirty years ago, almost every one of them had children doing a variety of jobs: selling peanuts and soft drinks in cinema halls, wiping tables in restaurants, packing goods in newspapers in grocery shops. And yes, children like Babu, assisting in garages and petrol pumps.
Organising evening classes for these children turned out to be extremely difficult. Unlike the tanneries, shops and restaurants were open until late, which meant that children were free only as late as 9
PM
. Children working in cinemas were free during the day when we were not. They all had individual employers whose permission was needed, and they were suspicious of us — our intentions. Talking to the traders’ association helped, and we did manage to overcome these challenges to some extent.
However, the night classes were a disaster. 9
PM
is no time to sit with any books, children need rest, sleep. All we did was tell stories, discuss them, it became a way to listen to their stories, get them to talk as freely as possible.
The children who worked in cinemas and restaurants stayed there, so it was easy to reach them. On the other hand, the
​
“
shop children” were housed in barrack-like arrangements in the slums nearby— several children packed into a room, the dwelling in the care of (typically) an
ayah
, an elderly lady who fed them early in the morning and at night, the employer providing the day-meal. These arrangements were supported by the employers. Money was sent periodically by the employers to the families of the children. In general, employers saw themselves as helping those families back in the villages.
​
“
The boy was simply loitering, and the family is starving, so I brought him here and am taking care of him. They get some money too,” said one.
A crucial dimension to all this was gender: all the children were boys, living entirely in a male world. Nowhere, whether it was at the workplace or where they slept, did they experience any female company. They were subject to all kinds of abuse: verbal, physical and sexual. They were working but had no access to money, and many of them stole, unafraid of the beatings that would result on discovery. They had no money to even think of buying a bus ticket to go home. Their only view of the world came from the Tamil movies in the three cinema halls, all of which they watched multiple times. The process of lumpenisation (a term for the underclass who lack class consciousness and are often exploited by reactionary forces in Marxist theory)  was easy to see.
We gave up on classes. What we did instead was organise sports sessions on Sunday afternoons in the grounds of Besant Theosophical School. Football turned out to be a good outlet for their energy and they enjoyed the solidarity of team games. We brought school children from nearby areas and playing together became a positive experience for all the children. The sessions ended with
samosas
, cutlets and ice cream, the kind of goodies the children longed for.
On Sunday evenings, we organised host families that children from the shop could visit and have dinner with: typically families of children from the Sunday sports sessions, many of whom were from the nearby slums. Including one child was no burden for them and most families welcomed them. Access to female company in family situations provided a softening of these children that no formal education could achieve.
The 2011 census gave a figure of 1.51 lakhs of child workers in Tamil Nadu, much reduced from that of 9.75 lakhs in 1981. The pandemic led to a sharp increase in the number of child workers, with schools closed and children
​
“
free” to join family work. The Periodic Labour Force Survey 2018 – 19 estimated the number of child workers in India to be between 18 and 33 lakhs.
Lessons learnt?
In all this, a natural question arises on why we could not or did not seek legal recourse to pull these children out of the labour force. Conversations with Madras Corporation officials revealed the lack of meaningful rehabilitation programmes that could provide alternatives for these children. Where we could talk to parents and families, it was much simpler to put the children back in school over some time (or not). Where children lived away from families, there was no similar recourse, and it must also be said that we lacked education and expertise in such work.
As mentioned earlier, we do not see these child workers in shops on
LB
Road now. However, small towns all across the country witness children engaged in similar work. Some of them assist their parents, but not all. I do not know if there are child workers living in barrack-like conditions, or how many, but the life of every such child is surely bleak, conditions that no civilised society can accept.
In the mid 90s, Tamil Nadu took up many schemes under the National Child Labour Project, especially night schools under the
NCLP
rehabilitation programmes in Virudhunagar, Vellore and Kanchipuram districts.
TNSF
was invited to work out a
​
“
curriculum” for the night schools and for training night school teachers. The Chennai experiences turned out to be helpful later in the context of the government-run
nilavoli palligal
(night schools)
.
The 2011 census gave a figure of 1.51 lakhs of child workers in Tamil Nadu, much reduced from that of 9.75 lakhs in 1981. The pandemic led to a sharp increase in the number of child workers, with schools closed and children
​
“
free” to join family work. The Periodic Labour Force Survey 2018 – 19 estimated the number of child workers in India to be between 18 and 33 lakhs.
Numbers are very important, but our stories, as all stories relating to child labour do, point to the stark reality of everyday life of each child worker. All these children ought to be in school, simply to keep them away from the labour force, so that they experience childhood.

Education for Peace, Human Rights, and Sustainable Development
Giridhar Rao
on UNESCO’s 2023 Recommendation which addresses some of humanity’s most urgent concerns.
In November 2023, at its 42
nd
General Conference in Paris,
UNESCO
adopted a
​
“
Recommendation on Education for Peace, Human Rights and Sustainable Development
”. A few weeks later, on 10 December 2023, we observed the
75
th
anniversary
of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (
UDHR
). Although obviously related to it, this post is not about that landmark Declaration. It is about the
UNESCO
Recommendation; about Human Rights
Education
.
Did you know that the
UDHR
is one of the most translated documents in the world?
As of 2023
, it has been
translated
into
561
languages!
This
UNESCO
Recommendation is in fact a revision of an influential
1974 Recommendation
. Long before the terms Global Citizenship Education (
GCED
) or Education for Sustainable Development (
ESD
) were coined, the 1974 document called on Member States to ensure that their educational policies were guided, among other things, by:
An international dimension and a global perspective in education at all levels and in all its forms;
Understanding and respect for all peoples, their cultures, civilisations, values and ways of life, including domestic ethnic cultures and cultures of other nations;
Awareness of the increasing global interdependence between peoples and nations.
The 2023 Recommendation builds on those principles. And half a century later, it addresses new concerns. These include:
Peace
. The Recommendation emphasises that peace is not merely the absence of war and armed conflict; it
​
“
requires an inclusive, democratic and participatory process”; where
​
“
internal and international conflicts are resolved through mutual understanding and cooperation, sustainable development in all its dimensions is achieved, universal access to lifelong and life-wide education… [and] extreme poverty is eradicated” – a far wider ambit for
​
“
peace”.
Global citizenship
. Likewise, this document sees
GCED
as essential to prepare citizens and nations to value cooperation and dialogue to address the collective challenges that humanity faces.
Gender equality
. As
UNESCO
notes
elsewhere,
​
“
Women still account for almost two-thirds of all adults unable to read”. The 2023 document focuses on gender equality as
​
“
key to the realisation of the right to education for all and for the empowerment of women and girls”. (Strangely, in the 1974 Recommendation, the words
​
“
women”,
​
“
girls” and
​
“
gender” do not occur even once in the document.
Check
for yourself!)
Climate change
education, as part of education for sustainable development,
​
“
should be integrated into curricula and across subjects to help understand and address the impacts of the climate crisis, to promote climate justice and to empower learners with the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes needed to act as agents of change. It should be learner-centred, experiential, contextualised, solutions-based and action-oriented.”
Digital literacy
includes
​
“
the ability to effectively search, access, critically evaluate, ethically produce, use and disseminate information… to detect and to combat disinformation and misinformation, hate speech, all forms of violence… harmful content and online abuse.…” In short,
​
“
think critically and click wisely
”!
While
NCF
stresses
​
“
Rootedness in India”, it also aims
​
“
to develop knowledge, skills, values, and dispositions that support responsible commitment to human rights, sustainable development and living, and global well-being, thereby reflecting a truly global citizen.” The alignment is clear between the
UNESCO
Recommendation and India’s
NCF
.
These
​
“
Action Areas” are very much a part of India’s National Curriculum Framework (
NCF
). For one, this
Indian policy document
too lays great emphasis on
ECCE
.
Further, while
NCF
stresses
​
“
Rootedness in India”, it also aims
​
“
to develop knowledge, skills, values, and dispositions that support responsible commitment to human rights, sustainable development and living, and global well-being, thereby reflecting a truly global citizen.” The alignment is clear between the
UNESCO
Recommendation and India’s
NCF
.
Although non-binding on Member States, the 1974 Recommendation influenced educational policies worldwide at many levels. The comprehensive 2023 Recommendation, which addresses so many of humankind’s current concerns, promises to do the same.

Are many Indians Entrepreneurs, because they have to be?
Gopi Sankar G
explores forms of entrepreneurship in India
Last year, some of us at the University, in collaboration with the community engagement cell, initiated a research project to examine the entrepreneurship landscape in a few nearby panchayats. However, this essay zooms out and presents a few thoughts on the forms of entrepreneurship that we see, especially in India. Significance of entrepreneurship is well recognised in the academic, practice, and policy worlds.
Entrepreneurship plays an important role in the economic development of a country since it creates employment opportunities and promotes innovation, drives economic growth and provides solutions to some pressing social challenges. Micro, Small, and Medium-sized Enterprises (
MSME
) form a considerable share of the global entrepreneurial landscape.
The World Bank estimates, based on data from 77 economies, that MSME
s
employ about 72% of private sector employees. In some countries, this figure is as high as 78%. It may be useful to note that
MSME
as a category is vast, with enterprises ranging from having one employee to 250 employees, locations varying from household premises to industrial areas. The first sub-category, Micro, itself is a broad category. Recognising the increasing importance of MSME
s
in the global economy, the United Nations has designated 27
th
June as
MSME
Day
.
In India, like in many other emerging markets, MSME
s
form a major contributor to industrial growth and employment generation. Recent estimates suggest that there are 59.3 million registered MSME
s
in the country, 98.5% of which would qualify as Micro enterprises. (India’s
Ministry of
MSME
defines this as
​
“
an enterprise where the investment in plant and machinery or equipment does not exceed two and a half crore rupees [0.29 million
USD
] and annual turnover does not exceed ten crore [1 million] rupees”.) MSME-related products accounted for 45.73% of India’s total exports in
FY
2023 – 24. According to
data
released by the Ministry of
MSME
, employment reported by MSME
s
in India rose from 27.30 million in 2020 – 21 to 97.40 million in 2023 – 24. Budgetary outlay of the Union Ministry of
MSME
during this period went up from
INR
5,664.22 crore (
USD
661.70 million) to
INR
22,138.01 crore (
USD
2586.21 million). If a 2024 report
1
published by
KPMG
is anything to go by, India has a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem with an increasing democratisation in the entrepreneurial landscape.  About 20% of the MSME
s
in the country are women-owned, close to 45% of the startups originate from tier
II
and
III
cities, and there are more than 1000 incubators facilitating and promoting entrepreneurship.
Entrepreneurs are not merely business owners but are
​
‘
change agents’, who innovate and introduce something new in the economy
In the popular imagination, there is a certain glamour associated with entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs.
Joseph Schumpeter
defined entrepreneurs as
​
“
individuals who exploit market opportunity through technical and/​or organizational innovation
”. According to him, the process of
​
“
creative destruction
” drives entrepreneurs. In his conceptualisation, entrepreneurs are not merely business owners but are
​
‘
change agents’, who innovate, who introduce something new in the economy. Entrepreneurs play a transformative role. Other entrepreneurial traits include risk taking, identify opportunities and pounce upon them, think creatively, and gainfully organise various resources. Therefore, entrepreneurship is perceived as something that is not everyone’s cup of tea. The Schumpeterian image of an entrepreneur is that of a passionate, driven, and adventurous individual, most likely a male.
However, there are other entrepreneurs who come across as an absolute contrast to this image. These are individuals who take up entrepreneurship as a source of livelihood, not because of opportunities identified but instead due to the lack of any. The entrepreneurship literature in the past decade or so has recognised the heterogeneity among entrepreneurs, at least as two categories, at a fundamental level – transformational entrepreneurs,
​
“
those who aim to create large, vibrant businesses that grow much beyond the scope of an individual’s subsistence needs and provide jobs and income for others
” and subsistence entrepreneurs,
​
“
those who become entrepreneurs as a means of providing subsistence income
” (Schoar 2010)
2
. Subsistence entrepreneurs dominate the entrepreneurial landscape in emerging markets like India. They start as tiny enterprises and remain so without any substantial growth in size or jobs created, giving employment to the entrepreneur and, at best, potentially to a few family members (often unpaid). Another distinction is in terms of
​
“
opportunity
” and
​
“
necessity
” entrepreneurship. There is a large scholarship in the burgeoning entrepreneurship literature
3
that refers to these two categories to distinguish motivations to start a business. Opportunity-driven entrepreneurs create businesses when they see a business opportunity, whereas necessity-driven entrepreneurs are forced into starting a business due to the lack of options in the labour market.
Insights from three rounds of Annual Surveys of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (
ASUSE
) conducted by the National Sample Survey Office illuminate some of these categories among entrepreneurs. Unincorporated sector enterprises include enterprises in non-agricultural sectors such as manufacturing, trade, and other services, ranging from those that require hardly any skill or capital to more sophisticated ones that require specific skills and significant investment. The three rounds of
ASUSE
were conducted in consecutive years starting from 2021 – 22.
A few instructive patterns emerge from
ASUSE
. Over the years, there has been a growth in the estimated number of establishments falling into unincorporated enterprises category. Consistently, a disproportionate share of the establishments is accounted for by Own Account Establishments (
OAE
), those establishments which have not employed even one hired worker on a regular basis. The share of OAE
s
among the estimated number of establishments for the years 2021 – 22, 2022 – 23, and 2023 – 24 is 85.93%, 85.08%, and 86.38%, respectively. A similar pattern is reflected in the data at the global level. The latest report of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, based on data collected from 51 economies, shows that a large number of entrepreneurs have created jobs for themselves, no one else; this highlights the limiting potential of entrepreneurial activity as a transformative one. The predominant form of ownership among the unincorporated enterprises surveyed under
ASUSE
is proprietorship. A significantly large share of enterprises, particularly OAE
s
, are located within household premises.
​
“
Other Retail Trade” (read, petty shops) form the greatest number of establishments under any one category, generating more than one-fourth of the total employment in this sector.
According to the
ASUSE
data, a significant 26 percent of unincorporated establishments in 2023 – 24 are headed by female proprietors. This observation is, perhaps, driven by the manufacturing sector with a share of about 58% female-headed enterprises. Further, intersection of social group-based identity and entrepreneurship makes the Indian context more complex. There is a strong relationship between caste and enterprise ownership. Evidence from the Economic Census suggests that historically marginalised social groups are under-represented in the overall enterprise ownership in India (Rakshit
&
Basole 2024)
4
. Among the few entrepreneurs who come from these identities, a disproportionately high share is engaged in enterprises that are subsistence oriented. Insights from
ASUSE
data vindicates this. Across the three rounds, more than 50% of the establishments are owned by Other Backward Classes while ownership by Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes hovers around 13% and 4%, respectively.
Thus,
ASUSE
data points to entrepreneurship in the form of tiny business units that mostly provide employment only to the entrepreneurs themselves, headed largely by individuals belonging to marginalised social categories. Given the extent of investment and scale of operations, most of them, if not all, would technically qualify as Micro enterprises. How should one interpret the growing number of such unincorporated establishments? Does it suggest the vibrancy of the entrepreneurial ecosystem seen among startups that facilitate individuals’ accumulation of wealth? Alternatively, is it an indication of growing distress among the poor and marginalised that forces individuals to turn to entrepreneurship for a livelihood?
Insights from my own research on unincorporated enterprises over the past 18 months make me lean towards the latter as a plausible scenario. I have been part of two field-based research projects that studied the motivation and operational details of unincorporated enterprises in a few taluks of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Data from our study suggests patterns consistent with that of
ASUSE
data. Interestingly, a large majority of our respondents reported lack of other opportunities as the reason for starting business, indicating that they are necessity-driven entrepreneurs.
The existing vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem in India seems to be elusive for the necessity-driven subsistence entrepreneurs. One should not forget that the number of people engaged in localised concentrations engage in this kind of entrepreneurship. Therefore, it is imperative to design and create support systems that cater to the specific needs of this sector. Systematic studies are required to estimate the resource base and skills, and to identify challenges and support needs of people in this sector. Business activities with growth potential should be identified. Entrepreneurs with transformative potential are to be identified as well. There should be a coordinated effort among various stakeholders including civil society organisations, financial institutions, training institutes, and other state and market players to create a conducive environment for the growth of entrepreneurship. Let this
MSME
day be an opportunity to start channeling energies towards this end.

Patrilocality as a Social Fact and a Sociological Thought Experiment
Vijitha Rajan
emphasises the need to think critically about the social construct of patrilocality within our society.
Patrilocality is a social norm, common in patriarchal societies, in which a married couple resides with or near the husband’s family.
Feminist scholars have argued that kinship structures and marriage practices that favour patrilocal residence significantly impact women’s right to an equal share of family property (see Dube, 1997; Geetha, 2007). According to Leela Dube (1997), post-marital residence profoundly impacts women’s access to and control over productive resources. It shapes how labour is organised, influences rights over the products of one’s labour, and affects women’s relationship to living spaces. This arrangement also significantly determines women’s bargaining power within the household and their relative autonomy.
Further, Dube points out that although there are exceptions, the ideal-typical household in much of India is the patrilineal, patrilocal joint family and that this places women in a precarious, liminal in-between space where they lose status within their natal family and are viewed with suspicion in their marital homes.
Socialisation in both homes and schools often reinforces traditional roles, particularly the notion that a woman’s rightful place is in her husband’s home.
Although there are exceptions, the ideal-typical household in much of India is the patrilineal, patrilocal joint family and that this places women in a precarious, liminal in-between space where they lose status within their natal family and are viewed with suspicion in their marital homes.
From a young age, girls are subtly, and sometimes overtly, guided to shape their character, behaviour, and aspirations around the expectation that they will one day leave their natal family to join another household. They often receive training in domestic skills like cooking, cleaning, and caregiving, as well as values such as obedience, modesty, and self-sacrifice, which are seen as essential for smoothly transitioning into their future marital homes. This emphasis on patrilocality serves as a constant reminder that their ultimate destination is elsewhere and this should shape not only their immediate actions but also their long-term goals. There are specific terms in regional languages that convey this expectation.
Culturally, heritage and family legacy are passed down exclusively through male ancestors and women are seen as
​
‘
marrying out’ and becoming part of their husband’s family. Textbooks inadvertently inculcate such patrilocal values.
For instance, in Tamil,
​
“
புகுந்த வீடு” (
pukunda veedu
) literally means
​
“
the home entered” or
​
“
the home she marries into”. It refers to a woman’s marital home and symbolises the expectation that her true, permanent place is with her husband’s family after marriage. Similar phrases are present in many other languages too. Even education or career choices may be influenced by this expectation, with families encouraging girls toward paths that align with their future roles as wives and daughters-in-law.
In this way, socialisation actively shapes not only a girl’s skills and values but also her very desires and ambitions and limits her self-perception to fit within a patrilocal framework.
To give a specific example from the school context, in the Government of Karnataka’s
Environmental Studies Text-cum-Workbook for Grade V
, published by the Karnataka Text Book Society (
KTBS
) and implemented from the academic year 2017 – 18, the second chapter on family includes a section on the family tree. In this section, a character named Manu introduces his family through a family tree diagram (
page 20
)
Taken from page-20 of KTBS’s
Environmental Studies Text-cum-Workbook for Grade V (
2017 – 2018)
From Manu’s perspective, this family tree holds patrilocal and patrilineal values by showing only his father’s side of the family, including his paternal grandparents (Vinutha and Ravi) and paternal great grandparents (Ramappa and Bhagyamma), while omitting relatives from his mother’s side. His mother Radha’s parents or paternal grandmother Vinutha’s parents are missing from the family tree. This layout implies that only his father’s lineage is relevant to his family identity and reinforces the idea that heritage and family legacy are passed down exclusively through male ancestors and that women are seen as
​
‘
marrying out’ and becoming part of their husband’s family. Textbooks inadvertently inculcate such patrilocal values!
The first movie in the 2024 Tamil anthology film
Hot Spot
, directed by Vignesh Karthick, presents an intriguing sociological thought experiment in relation to patrilocality. This movie begins with a heated dialogue between a couple about whether to proceed with their wedding. The man is furious that the woman wants to postpone the wedding after involving their families, but she reluctantly agrees after initial resistance. She warns him,
​
“
You will understand what I am saying when we have kids”. Puzzled, the man goes to sleep. Up to this point, nothing seems unusual.
The next day, as the man’s family prepares to meet the woman’s, there’s a stark role reversal: men manage domestic duties while women take the lead in family decisions. The woman’s mother demands a dowry from the man’s family and insists he quit his job after marriage to focus on household responsibilities. His opinions are ignored, and after the marriage, he moves into her home, expected to adjust to her family’s routine, handle chores, and make sacrifices. The woman’s romantic gestures don’t alleviate his frustrations which in turn lead to tensions between him and his father-in-law. The conflict escalates to the point where the wife slaps the husband.
At that moment, the man wakes up from his sleep, realising that this was all part of his dream. The world returns to
​
‘
normal’, where he hears his mother doing all the household work alone. The man suddenly begins to understand why the woman felt anxious about their marriage. The day starts with the man’s family visiting the woman’s house for the traditional bride-seeing ritual. The women are now shy, diffident, and passive unlike the men. With the unusual dream still fresh in his mind, the man speaks up and says that after marriage, he and his wife want to live separately, or in other words, prefer neolocality rather than patrilocality. He deliberately critiques the
​
“
conditions apply” clause that usually applies to women after marriage.
There are ways of acting, thinking, and feeling that exist outside the individual’s consciousness. Social phenomena, institutions, norms, and similar elements are external and independent of human beings. Social phenomena have a reality
sui generis
, meaning they possess a unique reality of their own.
The movie provokes us to engage in a thought experiment which challenges the gendered order that normalises patrilocality. Although the protagonist’s speech about gender equality, questioning traditional roles, patrilocality, and subordination of women may sound a bit preachy, the film leaves the audience with an uncomfortable feeling. It highlights the blatant absurdity of a man performing traditional gendered roles, while in real life, married women are expected to perform these roles without question, despite their inherent insensibility and injustice.
The protagonist here asserts that altering the dominant gendered world is indeed possible. He takes the initiative to declare that the couple will live as a separate family or alternate between the families of both the man and the woman.
The thought experiment that this story presents helps us question the social facts taken for granted, in particular, gender. According to Émile Durkheim (1858−1917), there are ways of acting, thinking, and feeling that exist outside the individual’s consciousness. Social phenomena, institutions, norms, and similar elements are external and independent of human beings. Social phenomena have a reality
sui generis
, meaning they possess a unique reality of their own. These social facts are endowed with a compelling and coercive power, which imposes itself upon individuals, regardless of their wishes. The force of social facts is felt in varying ways and degrees, especially when one tries to resist them. Even when individuals manage to break free from these rules, it is always a struggle against their influence. Over time, the sense of constraint may diminish because these social facts gradually give rise to habits and inner tendencies and make their influence less noticeable but still pervasive.
The thought experiment in
Hotspot
offers hope in the younger generation’s capacity to rework the gendered social fact of patrilocality.
Patrilocality, as a deeply ingrained social structure, remains resilient even in ostensibly progressive marriages that may eschew religious observances or avoid extravagant ceremonies. Despite such modern practices, the new family unit often finds its primary allegiance tied to the male partner’s family. This attachment persists regardless of whether the couple lives separately which in turn illustrates that patrilocality is more than mere cohabitation — it’s a social allegiance difficult to break. Any substantial deviation from this norm may invite repercussions.
The thought experiment in
Hotspot
offers hope for the younger generation’s capacity to rework the gendered social fact of patrilocality. Hopefully, these reworkings across different communication platforms and educational materials, including textbooks, will eventually transform the cultures of patrilocality within our homes and society.

Children’s Literature: Broadening Perspectives, Encouraging Initiatives
Sonika Parashar
highlights the need for initiatives like
KathaVana
that support making children’s literature an integral part of every child’s life.
On 14 December 2023, Azim Premji University’s Bengaluru campus came alive with at least a thousand children and teachers from different government and low-fee-paying private schools. The visitors had come to join the festivities of
KathaVana
2023 — the annual bilingual children’s literature festival of the University, organised in collaboration with the field arm of the
Azim Premji Foundation
.
The theme for the festival was
Teachers Writing for Children
. Within the broader contours of this theme, we organised three events: a Teacher Professional Development workshop, an online children’s literature festival week, and an on-campus
mela
. For this post, I would refrain from sharing the whats, whys, and hows of the event as they are available
here
. What I do want to share here is essentially a plea.
In most of our minds, children’s literature is considered equivalent to storybooks for children, especially the ones that impart morals to children. However, not only storybooks, but children’s literature also means a rich and diverse genre that encompasses a wide array of literary works specifically crafted for young readers, from infancy to adolescence, including poetry, graphic novels and comics, nonfiction, performative traditions of literature, picture books and literature that need not necessarily impart morals.
Oral storytelling traditions, early folk tales and oral narratives passed down through generations laid the foundation for the development of children’s literature as a distinct genre. They focussed on themes and issues relevant to the experiences and developmental stages of children.
Performative traditions are also considered children’s literature. These include, but are not limited to, puppet shows, storytelling performances, and theatrical productions with or without a moral output, specifically tailored for children. While they may not fit into traditional definitions of written or printed texts, these forms of storytelling and expression are integral components of the broader landscape of children’s literature and shape young audiences’ literary experiences. Thus, we need to expand our understanding of children’s literature and not restrict ourselves to a narrow definition of the same.
Unfortunately, not all appreciate the breadth of children’s literature and its pivotal role in children’s lives. They are often dismissed as mere entertainment or post-academic activity. But it is imperative that stakeholders in education — teachers, parents, policymakers, leaders in education, etc., — understand that children’s literature offers numerous benefits that contribute to children’s intellectual, emotional, social, and cognitive development.
Children’s literature stimulates the imagination and fosters creativity by transporting young audiences to fantastical worlds, introducing them to diverse characters and settings, and encouraging them to envision possibilities beyond their immediate surroundings. It addresses a wide range of emotions and experiences, helping children develop emotional intelligence, empathy, and social awareness.
When children encounter characters facing diverse challenges, triumphs, and setbacks, they learn to identify and regulate their own emotions, understand others’ perspectives, and navigate complex social dynamics. Literature exposes children to diverse cultures, perspectives, and experiences, fostering cultural awareness, empathy, and appreciation for diversity. Through stories featuring characters from different backgrounds, ethnicities, and identities, children gain insight into the richness and complexity of the world around them, promoting tolerance, inclusivity, and respect for others.
If one wants more reasons to include children’s literature in a child’s life, then, yes, research shows that it helps children gain academic success as well by contributing to their language and cognitive development. It expands their vocabulary, enhances their understanding of grammar and syntax, and exposes them to different writing styles and literary devices.
Reading aloud to children from an early age can also foster phonemic awareness and fluency, laying a strong foundation for literacy development. Children’s literature promotes cognitive development as well. It challenges children to think critically, make connections between ideas, analyse characters’ motivations and actions, and predict story outcomes. It also enhances cognitive skills such as problem-solving, inference-making, and perspective-taking, and fosters intellectual growth and cognitive flexibility. For me personally, above all, children’s literature brings a sense of enjoyment, curiosity, and wonder. It is a pleasurable experience which makes learning and living life an enjoyable journey.
India has a rich tradition of storytelling, performative and oral literature in various Indian languages. Unfortunately, these are not considered to be children’s literature. In addition, the availability of quality print children’s literature in these languages remains limited compared to English-language children’s literature.
English has been consistently preferred over other Indian languages in our country. This leads to a demand for English-medium educational materials, including children’s literature, by parents, schools, and publishers. This preference perpetuates the marginalisation of other Indian languages and discourages the creation and dissemination of children’s literature in Indian languages.
Accordingly, there is a lack of investment and infrastructure for publishing and promoting children’s literature in different Indian languages. Further, children’s literature in Indian languages needs more experimentation with themes, language use, illustrations, structure, and other elements that make children’s literature attractive, interesting, and meaningful for children. Perhaps it is because of these too that children’s literature in English is preferred over that in Indian languages.
Considering these thoughts, my plea to stakeholders in education, thus, is to expand our view of the meaning of children’s literature, recognise its importance in children’s lives and encourage quality children’s literature of different forms and styles, especially in Indian languages. More training, exposure and experience is needed for people interested in publishing or working with children’s literature in Indian languages, including work on translations across languages.
More initiatives need to be taken up to promote access to children’s literature in various Indian languages for children from different backgrounds and support local authors, performers, illustrators, and artists working in the field of children’s literature. We need to organise children’s literature festivals, book fairs, storytelling sessions, community libraries, and events that showcase local oral and performative traditions. These will expand everyone’s understanding of children’s literature, share its relevance in children’s lives, and respond to the dearth of children’s literature in Indian languages.
KathaVana, organised by our University, is one such initiative. I hope and wish for many more such initiatives that support making children’s literature an integral part of every child’s life.

MA
in Education: Why it is more than just practice
It’s a practical experience crafted to prepare education professionals to improve the quality of education in India, highlights

We drove through lush patches of cotton and tuvar (pigeon pea) fields, and reached a village. We sat in a clean, well-organised room, and observed the ongoing processes in this
Anganwadi
centre. The teacher was conducting a range of activities with children in the age group of 2.5 to 5 years— getting the children to pick their
ID
cards as a way of marking attendance, narrating a story, holding a conversation with them on what they saw on their way to the
Anganwadi
centre and so on.
After observing them for a little while, the teacher asked me to introduce myself to the children.
I said,
​
“
Like your teacher, I too am a teacher. Once you finish school, you will go to college. I teach in a college”.
Two children immediately asked,
​
“
Are you Kashish akka’s teacher?”
“
Yes, I am. I teach Kashish and her friends,” I said.
“
When will Kashish akka come back to teach us?” they asked.
Like many of my colleagues, I was visiting Kalaburgi, one of the
Azim Premji Foundation’s District Institutes
, also a site for Field Practice for the
MA
in Education students, to meet our students and colleagues, who were in the Field for a period of twelve weeks as a part of their programme.
While speaking to Kashish and her classmates, our second year Master’s in Education (
MA
in Education
) students, the same evening, on what was one of the most significant takeaways from the course, one heard a resounding chorus — the most valued experience for most of them was being with children, and directly engaging with them, assisting the teacher, engaging with the community and the working of an
Anganwadi
centre.
The teachers, helpers, children at the centre, the community they visited, and the
autowala
uncle who ferried them to the centre and back every day had all formed relationships that would be cherished for a lifetime. They celebrated Diwali together, visited their homes, had their moments and opportunities immersing themselves in the local culture. Their inner circle of peers and faculty mentors as immediate carers — both for their learning and wellbeing seemed to have imprinted on this otherwise rigorous time away from the campus in Bengaluru.
It was a proud moment to realise that our students had (to a good extent) imbibed and appreciated what was at the core of this programme, carefully crafted for them, by innumerable colleagues and the supportive teachers and officials in the system.
Through the field practice, students pursue a course on the focus subject area, teacher professional development, conduct a mini-research, observe-prepare and assist in conducting professional development sessions, plan, teach and reflect on their teaching experience. This rigorous immersive schedule is facilitated by faculty with rich direct engagement with the education system.

As a part of this preparation, this group of students were involved in peer-teaching. A striking aspect of this exercise was the
​
‘
feedback’ the students provided and received from their peers and the faculty during a peer-teaching session.
The maturity and openness with which the peers participated as learners, and the
​
‘
teacher/​facilitator students’ received systematic feedback on every aspect of their teaching, i.e., their plan, the presentation, choice of content, activities, preparation and clarity of explanation, was incredible.
It was a proud moment to realise that our students had (to a good extent) imbibed and appreciated what was at the core of this programme, carefully crafted for them, by innumerable colleagues and the supportive teachers and officials in the system.
At the core of this field
practice is
​
‘
practical experience’
— that hopes to enable students to examine the linkages between ground realities of schools, teachers, children, and their contexts — develop dispositions like care and ethical concerns related to working with children and teachers, experience of local culture, plan, teach, reflect, and develop the sensibilities required to become educational practitioners.
Students acknowledged that they were able to appreciate the nuances of theories at the core of perspective building, and that a theoretical notion may play out very differently in reality when one is immersed in a context.
For instance, the notion of a child one perceives through understanding theories of child development, a complex concept such as that of
​
‘
childhood’ as assumed through a theoretical explanation may be very different from the actuality of that phenomenon; the role language and contexts play in the work of a teacher; how policy statements trickle down and get implemented on the ground; that larger systemic change is about the continuous ongoing effort on the ground and so on.
Further, theoretical principles are critical to making sound plans, yet they are plausible for effective implementation only when rooted in the contexts and reality within which the plans must be operationalised in.
The Field Practice course in the
MA
Education programme has all the above as an explicit focus and is not merely aimed at
practising
and becoming
habitual
to master a skill as the term
practice
typically suggests.

Implicit to the long practical component is the growth of personal-interpersonal-professional aspects that is inevitable through an immersive experience.
As one of the students remarked, this course, the semester-long Field Practice of the
MA
in Education programme, is a
​
‘
game-changer’. And indeed, it seems so, in the multiple ways in which the experience has impacted students’ learning and growth, both as individuals and professionals. All these efforts are in the singular hope that our students will be true
​
‘
game-changers’ to improve the quality of education and schooling in India.

Understanding and Countering Hate: Politics, Technologies and Culture
Eveleen K. Sidana
highlights how hate distorts, displaces, and erodes diversity, normalised further by digital technologies.
As we commemorate 18
th
June as the
International Day for Countering Hate Speech
, we face many questions about the insidious workings of hate as well as the challenge of dealing with its ominous effects. On one hand unadulterated hate finds its way into our ordinary lives through words, behaviour and action so much so that even formal policies on immigrants appear to be driven by its negating effects. For example, the Rohingya have been persecuted under successive regimes in their own country, Myanmar, amplified by hatred fueled by online social media platforms such as Facebook. They have also been targets of misinformation and hate in countries where they migrated as refugees fleeing genocide (Guzman, 2022).
On the other, there are voices of reason calling for solidarity, inclusion, thought and deliberation over how intense affective politics of hatred engulfs people, and particularly, youth. For hate, and its accompanying emotions of anxiety, insecurity, suspicion, not only dehumanise and wound those that are targeted but also those who hate – as the latter feel that they have taken control of the situation. This feeling of taking control appears to respond to a state of precarity of those who hate at a personal, social, economic and political level.
Hate allows for such a displacement from context to social identity to occur as vulnerable groups can be held responsible for complex, structural and multi-factored issues such as inflation, unemployment and climate distress. I suggest that firstly, we need to understand how hate is not a response to identities. Instead it actively shapes and frames identities. Secondly, this encompassing hate needs to be tackled beyond its association with identities and by considering the act of speaking hate itself as an act of violence. Thirdly, if hate is a response to the political and socio-economic uncertainty that the youth particularly face today, then greater awareness and response to the conditions that normalise hate are needed. This would require a critical and integrated approach involving educational institutions, industry, media and law.
How do we define the boundaries of hate speech?
Is it individual or social or is it both?
Section 196
of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (henceforth
BNS
) lays down punishment for promoting enmity between different groups, targeting groups of people based on religion, place of birth, residence, race, caste and communities, through words, symbols, actions and conduct.
Sections 298
&
299
further deal with outraging religious feelings.  Hate speech is about hurting the dignity of an individual as a member of a group or of a particular identity, advocating threatening violence against a group of people based on their identity, inciting wrongful and criminal action against any group of people. Is it enough to apologise for being hateful or dismiss it as an isolated instance of ill humour? Can we counter hate at an individual level, or would it require a systematic effort and collective approach? For even if it is articulated at an individual level, hate speech has the force of language as it can be used to identify and represent entire communities. For example, use of terminologies like
​
‘
love jihad’ or
​
‘
terrorist’ in reference to the Muslim community members create a grammar of hate that gets normalised when repeated. Is it possible to address the crowd mentality that fuels hate speech? Can we call the wounding capacities of words as
​
“
assaultive discourse”?
1
For conceptualising hate as discourse allows us to question the powerful actors and institutions that support it. But what does hate do? How does it shape bodies and minds?
What does hate do?
‘
It takes a village to raise a person; it takes a village to hate one.’
2
Hate has often been defined as a negation of the dignity of a person or community. As discussed above, hate negates on the basis of gender, caste, race, religion and sexuality. To understand hate, however, we must also ask what does hate create or affirm? What kind of social relations does it generate beyond what it negates? Hate places the person who is
​
‘
othered’ squarely at the center of a group identity fixing the otherwise fluid boundaries of identity and personhood. Because of the way the bundle of powerful emotions circulate, fix and reify identities, it has been used as an effective political tool to polarise, as we shall see later.
The group of people who could have been part of a multitude teeming with differences and creativity get hemmed in with few strokes and splashes of hate. The politics of hate (mis)represents by creating sameness where there was diversity and cancels the voice of the
​
‘
other.’  Further, the social and cultural politics of hate and its intimidating effects erase inter- and intra-community interactions and relations in the present and their potential in the future. Hate aligns some against those others (Ahmed, 2004).
“
Because we love, we hate, and hate is what brings us together
,” writes Sara Ahmed of the white nationalists who essentialise their own identities through rage against mixed racial couples, giving foreign aid, or immigrants. For it is not just a disagreement over social, political or economic issues or cultural frictions between people. Hate is simultaneously visceral and embodied, and personal and communal. Hate shapes minds and bodies in ways similar to our response to the fear of Covid-19 virus. We saw during the pandemic how certain bodies of the poor, the Muslim, the migrant workers were seen as carriers of the virus and therefore marked out as threatening figures coalescing fear and uncertainty with hate and framing differences as dangerous.
When the emotion and speech acts of hate are repeated, they gain meaning and force fixing social boundaries. For example, the repeated language of hate between the Hindu and Muslim communities fixes the relation between the two communities and fixes their self-identification as well. Despite being an unstable force, hate gets used as a political and cultural tool to maintain power relations and normalise oppression. But how does hate normalise oppression?
While the anonymity allows social media users to weaponise hate, the algorithms of social media incentivise hate because they allow for continued engagement in an economic system in which attention is commoditised and monetised so that the greater the attention captured, the higher the profit.
Digital Platforms: Habituated to hate
In the critically acclaimed Netflix series
Adolescence
(2025)
directed by Philip Barantini, a teenager, Jamie Miller, is accused of murdering a girl who is his classmate. Investigations by police and psychiatric evaluation reveal Jamie’s strongly held beliefs and attitude towards women emanating from deeply held and actively ingrained gender stereotypes. The series showed how it was not just the teenager but also his family that faced backlash from the community and got isolated.
The series expresses the deep-rooted nature of hate as it gets ingrained in the subconscious before young minds even have the tools to process how they became aligned and accustomed to extreme thoughts leading to loss of life – their own as well as those of others. It becomes painfully evident that there are victims on both sides of this mounting wall even when everything appears normal on the surface. Many women have been targeted and continue to be subjected to threats of brutal sexual violence for expressing disagreements or just by association with any person who has expressed a divergent opinion or a disagreement than those of the virtual majority view. The more hate becomes viral, the more it mobilises, intensifies and alienates. The circulation of hate itself produces dangerous occasions of violence such as lynchings, mob violence and riotous situations have demonstrated time and again.
In the
Bully Bai
case, images of women of minority communities were displayed online in a fake auction hurting their dignity and fetishising their bodies. In many such cases it is the youth who get mobilised to hate by the act of repeated articulation as well as the technologies of amplification. Can we really ignore these speeches and acts of visceral hate as a few sporadic cases of brainwashed people?
Section 353(2) of the
BNS
acknowledges and lays out the punishment for the use of electronic means used to circulate misinformation, rumours and create enmity between different groups of people based on
​
“
religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, caste or community or any ground whatsoever.” However, to really arrest the use of digital technologies in amplifying hate, we must understand what the digital medium affords when it allows infinite circulation of emotions, what it offers as anonymity, and how it seduces and habituates so that a potentially violent and extreme act also appears mundane.
Safiya Noble
,
UCLA
Race and Technology Center, in her work
Algorithms of Oppression
demonstrated that social media platforms have intrinsic racial and gender biases and their presentation as neutral technology is a myth. While the anonymity allows social media users to weaponise hate, the algorithms of social media incentivise hate because they allow for continued engagement in an economic system in which attention is commoditised and monetised so that the greater the attention captured, the higher the profit.
3
Mediated by digital networks, hate becomes seductive and captivating. This seduction is engineered externally through the modes of engagement by the platforms and internally through the algorithms of social media platforms. Both habituate to hate their largest constituency — young and impressionable minds like Jamie Miller.
“
Tackling Hate Speech is the responsibility of all – governments, societies, private sector, starting with individual women and men. All are responsible, all must act.”
Normalising Violence
The powers that stabilise hate today are political and cultural but also technological. In 2023, the Minister of Information, Government of Karnataka, announced that they would institute a center for monitoring hate and misinformation. Bangalore city police have been monitoring online social media for hate and propaganda since 2021. Recently, a Special Action force has been instituted to monitor communal crimes and hate speeches in three districts in the state.
India Hate Lab
, Project of Centre for the Study of Organized Hate, Washington D.C., had previously published reports on the organised nature of hate speeches targeting minority communities, particularly the Muslim communities. They have documented 1,165 such instances of hate speech in 2024, a 74 percent increase since 2023 (
Hate Speech Events in India, Report 2024)
. These speech acts of hate not only remain within the timeframe of an event but get amplified and intensified by big media and social media. They fix inter-community and intra-community relations, framing the politics of the present but also narrowing political possibilities in the future.  Social media platforms carrying hate messages have the effect of normalising violence but also desensitising youth as they are the largest consumers of social media. While intense emotions circulate, digital media platforms desensitise making it easier to speed up the economy of hate. How then do we deal with this dichotomy that mostly affects the youth, on the one hand desensitising them and on the other intensifying emotions leading to drastic acts of violence against certain groups of people?
Tackling Hate
The principles that guide the United Nations Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech (2019) express that
​
“
Tackling Hate Speech is the responsibility of all – governments, societies, private sector, starting with individual women and men. All are responsible, all must act.” To tackle hate speech, we not only have to consider the political, social and cultural impact and outcomes, but we must consider hate speech itself as an act of violence. This violence needs to be tackled beyond the judicial sphere. Considering hate speech as an act of violence can help us understand the desensitisation of youth to violence through the capture of attention by digital media as well as its simultaneous emotional intensification by circulation. Appreciating the fact that communal, misogynist, racial and casteist hate is mediated by digital media also requires serious deliberation on the policies that regulate social media and digital platforms beyond debates of privacy. It also requires that we consciously understand our social media consumption as actions that create sub-cultures and processes that shape publics.
Hate encompasses, defines, discriminates, fixes and habituates. It anchors identities and generates fear.  To deal with its devastating and long-lasting effects, we need to systematically diagnose how young people encounter, react to as well as participate in hate speech as a social practice. It is here that educational institutes can play a significant role in researching the hate ecosystem and equipping young minds to tackle the myriad mechanisms of misinformation that have played a central role in launching and magnifying hate. This would help us create preparatory tools to deal with hatred and its consequences at a cultural and social level as well as open the blackbox by which digital platforms promote hate.

Looms, schools and Special Economic Zones: Childhood, Education and Labour in Kanchipuram
Miriam Thangaraj
offers an ethnographic perspective on child labour
​
‘
eradication’ efforts.
Writing or speaking of child labour is often such provocative and evocative business! I remember attending a consultation on child labour in the lead up to amending the
1986 Child Labour (Protection and Regulation) Act,
where speaker after speaker spoke of the need for a complete prohibition of child labour in India – anything less, we were told, was a national shame, a national sin. Or, as one of them put it pithily,
​
“
what we need is a blanket ban [on child labour] – not a handkerchief ban!”
I could see where they were coming from. Unlike in the 1980s, where determinations about child labour prohibitions were made on the basis of the kind of labour – in particular, whether it was hazardous or not – approaches to child labour in the 1990s increasingly shifted to focus on the
​
‘
child.’ Child labour, these approaches argued, should be banned because childhood was a time for play and school, not work.
As national efforts towards universalising elementary education gained ground, these demands for prohibiting child labour were increasingly framed in terms of children’s right to education: that is, the problem with child labour, irrespective of the conditions of work, was that it kept children out of school.
​
‘
Handkerchief bans’ that regulated child labour – for instance, making exceptions when children worked alongside their families in traditional occupations – would still keep children out of school; and were therefore, strongly denounced.
“
What we need is a blanket ban [on child labour] – not a handkerchief ban!”
But what happens when child labour prohibitions are unexceptionally enforced, as they were in Kanchipuram? In Kanchipuram, the famed
kanjeevaram
silk sari, has been woven for centuries on household-based handlooms that children have grown up working on. In the 1920s, for instance, when
N G Ranga
, the freedom-fighter and farmers’ leader, visited the area during his studies at Oxford, he described the neighbourhood hiring system of boys as weavers’ apprentices as a systematic (if slow) intergenerational transfer of skills.
And in the 1970s, when Yvonne Arterburn wrote her landmark account of Kanchipuram’s silk cooperatives, she marvelled at interdependent relations that produced the
kanjeevaram
: not only inter-household
​
‘
attachments’ of production, but the intergenerational relations encapsulated by the sari’s
korvai-
border. It was children, plying the border-shuttle in tandem with parents or master-weavers, who produced the uniquely interlocked
korvai
.
More children, Arterburn noted matter-of-factly, were learning to weave on loom than learning in school (Arterburn, 1982).
At the turn of the millennium, however, in response to global pressure, Kanchipuram was declared an
​
‘
area of high child labour concentration’ and the National Child Labour Project began using
​
‘
child labour raids’ to
​
‘
rescue’ children from looms into schools. These raids were dramatic affairs, as boys tried to outrun the posse of officials bearing down Kanchipuram’s narrow alleys or girls jumped into water-drums and cupboards to hide. Like a game of hide-and-seek, some of them laughed at the memory when I met them (in 2009), while others were still disgusted, recalling being picked up from the looms and put into vans like
​
“
street dogs.” These vans then deposited children at transition education centres and bridge programmes where they learnt
​
‘
the basics,’ before being enrolled in neighbourhood government schools.
What happened to these children who were raided and rescued by the state? If children were moved into schools, then a significant number was also driven into less visible spaces of work. In the 1990s, as agrarian distress fueled migration to Kanchipuram, many migrant children, typically from lower-caste households, entered the loom-space as helpers.
By learning (and earning) their way to apprentices, then
coolie-
weavers, then independent weavers, they and their families sought the relative economic security the looms offered. When the raids began however, economic pressures pushed these children – nearly a third of those rescued, according to Project officials – into the less visible spaces of rice-mills and brick-kilns.
Of the two-thirds who made it to bridge classes, the older children were frustrated by the classroom disciplines of sitting quietly in one place with a book in hand: a far cry from the looms where work was sound-tracked by the
TV
blaring in the corner and the boys, in particular, were constantly running in and out on errands for weavers. You never
did
anything in class – you never made anything – as Uma snorted, still pained by the
​
“
time-waste,” even 5 years later. For Kishore, on the other hand, school felt like too much work – but without pay, he was bitter. Running the clock down, these girls and boys had returned to the looms or joined retail silk-houses, the moment they turned 15 (and were no longer classed as children by the state).
Cash in hand was a must – recalling the childhood institution of
inam-kaas
(lit. award-money) on the looms: apprentices – in addition to their wages – were paid a small fortnightly
inam
by their master-weavers, which was theirs by right to spend as they pleased. From the
murukku, sundal
and
kadala-mittai
of yesteryear to the cornucopia of packaged snacks, soft-drinks and chocolates of the present – such were joys of childhood that children’s work afforded.
Most of the younger cohorts of children – about half of those rescued – made it successfully into government schools, however. I spent a significant time with some of these cohorts, observing as they navigated middle-school with varying facility. Where the girls were largely accommodated into the writing-centred life of classrooms, assiduously
​
“
copying” line-by-line into their notebooks – not unlike the line-upon-line laying down of the warp on the loom – most of the boys remained on the fringes.
“
Escaping” from the classroom, as they gleefully put it (using the English word), they roamed the neighbourhood, looking for work in the booming local economy of construction-sites and biriyani-shops or, during wedding and festival seasons, hawking water-packets and putting up
shamiyanas. Kai-la kaas theva,
Miss, they insisted – cash in hand was a must – recalling the childhood institution of
inam-kaas
(lit. award-money) on the looms: apprentices – in addition to their wages – were paid a small fortnightly
inam
by their master-weavers, which was theirs by right to spend as they pleased. From the
murukku, sundal
and
kadala-mittai
of yesteryear to the cornucopia of packaged snacks, soft-drinks and chocolates of the present – such were joys of childhood that children’s work afforded.
Indeed, nearly everyone in the classrooms I observed participated in some or other waged-work after-school or over the weekends – reeling silk for master-weavers, but in mango orchards and sand-mining operations nearby or in local
appalam
companies, cell-phone shops and trades-work; their earnings, funding much-awaited lunch-break forays into the bakeries and
petti
-shops nearby.  Of course, given the child labour awareness campaigns frequently organised at school, teachers frequently denounced such work – chores were ok, but why do you need to work for money, they often scolded; but children persisted, often speaking in highly moral terms about refusing to trouble their poor parents for pocket-money. Work, thus, remained a regular, if now, more underground part of children’s lives in Kanchipuram’s neighbourhoods.
The unilateral and categorical understandings of and responses to children’s work – even if morally justified – may also render children even more vulnerable.
Given such spotty and interrupted schooling experiences – exacerbated by chronically under-resourced government systems – it was perhaps no surprise that students struggled in secondary school, when the no-detention mandate of the Right to Education Act no longer applied. By 2012, when I returned to Kanchipuram, the vast majority of these students were no longer in school, having dropped out to work as electricians, plumbers, caterers and salespeople in the informal sector or as contract labour in nearby Special Economic Zones (SEZ
s
). Drawn to SEZ
s
by relaxed labour laws and tax regulations, multinational companies like Nokia, Hyundai, or Renault also attracted thousands of local youth to their globally-connected assembly-lines – including those from Kanchipuram’s weaving neighbourhoods.
Well over half the rescued children in the neighbourhood where I was living – the girls and young women, in particular – were in SEZ-companies, their school-leaving certificates serving as passports to low-paid, precarious assembly-line work. If I was dismayed that state interventions had protected 14-year-olds from working on the looms even as 16- and 17-year-olds worked on the deliberately deregulated spaces of SEZ
s
, then the girls themselves were unfazed. It was
​
“
jolly,” they insisted to me; the covert chatter on the assembly-line and the much-looked-forward-to lunch-break snacks not unlike the pleasures of their erstwhile classrooms.
What can Kanchipuram’s experience tell us this
World Day Against Child Labour
? Not least that unilateral and categorical understandings of and responses to children’s work – even if morally justified – may also render children even more vulnerable. Especially when the state’s meagre social spending means that economically precarious households have few social security provisions they can access; and when neighbourhood schools are bare-educational and chronically under-resourced, given the failure of successive governments to live up to their promises of 6%
GDP
spending on education.
Childhoods, whether on the loom or in school, are shaped not only by culture and tradition, but also by the local and global political-economic conditions within which families produce their subsistence. Indeed, the meaning and value of children’s work – whether in school or on the loom and elsewhere – is also derived from the political-economic context that shapes their present and future opportunities for the
​
‘
good life’ that children and families hope for.
Perhaps it is appropriate that children have the last word. People are often surprised when I talk about working children’s unions in India and other parts of the global south, but as the
Kundapur Declaration
(at First International Meeting of Working Children in 1996) puts it:
​
“
We want respect and security for ourselves and the work that we do.”
​
“
We want an education system whose methodology and content are adapted to our reality.”
​
“
We want to be consulted in all decisions concerning us, at local, national or international level.”
​
“
We are against exploitation at work but we are for work with dignity with hours adapted so that we have time for education and leisure.”

যে কথা কখনো লিখিনি তা লিখতে গেলে অনেক কথা ভিড় করে আসে। সব কথাই বলতে চায় আমায় লেখ আমায় লেখ, তাই কোনটা লিখি আর কোনটা রাখি বেছে নিতেই সময় যায় পেরিয়ে। তবু যখন লেখার ফরমাশ এসেছে তখন লিখতেই হবে।
জন্মের পর থেকে ২২ বছর শান্তিনিকেতনে বেড়ে ওঠা আর তার পরে আরও ৪০ বছর নিবিড় যোগাযোগ কম সময় নয়। বাড়ির বাইরে প্রথম নিয়মিত পা রেখেছি আনন্দ পাঠশালায় যাব বলে। ইংরেজি ভাষায় তাকে হয়ত নার্সারি স্কুল বলবে, আমাদের কাছে তা ছিল আনন্দেরই পাঠশালা। রবীন্দ্রনাথকে পাওয়ার শুরু সেখানেই, যদিও এই প্রতিষ্ঠানটির জন্ম হয়েছে তাঁর মৃত্যুর ১৬-১৭ বছর পরে। চার বছর বয়সে রবীন্দ্রনাথকে কিভাবে পেলাম বোঝার ক্ষমতা হয়নি। পরে বুঝেছি পাঠশালার সঙ্গে আনন্দের সম্পর্কটা যে নিবিড় সেই বোধটি রাবীন্দ্রিক। গাছ গাছালি, ফল ফুল, পশু পাখি, পোকা মাকড় যে আমাদের জীবনের বেড়ে ওঠার সঙ্গী, সেটা ওই বয়সেই বুঝে গিয়েছিলাম। তাই আমার ও আমার মত অনেকেরই গাছতলার ছায়া, গাছের ডাল, পাখির কলরব, ফুলের রং আর সুগন্ধ ভাল লাগতে শুরু করেছিল। বরং দেহলী বাড়ির বারান্দায় বসে অ আ ক খ শিখতে গেলে মন উসখুস করত, ওই বোধহয় কাঠবেড়ালিটা পালিয়ে গেল, পাশ দিয়ে প্রজাপতি উড়ে গেলে মনকে শান্ত রাখা কঠিন হত।
আনন্দ পাঠশালায় লেখা পড়া কি শিখেছিলাম বিশেষ মনে নেই, কিন্তু প্রকৃতি বিষয়ে আন্তরিক আগ্রহ সেখান থেকেই জন্মেছিল। প্রকৃতিকে আপন করে দেখা, এ তো রবীন্দ্রনাথেরই অবদান। দু বছর পেরোলে  ভর্তি হলাম পাঠভবনে। হাতে কয়েকটি বই খাতা আর একটা মাটিতে বসার আসন। বই খাতা আর আসনগুলি বিশ্বভারতী সমবায় থেকে কেনা, বাবা কিনে এনেছিলেন। এই সমবায় ১৯১৫ সালে প্রতিষ্ঠিত। ভারতে বোধহয় একমাত্র বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় যার নিজস্ব marketing cooperative  আছে। বিশ্বভারতীর নিজস্ব সমবায় ব্যাঙ্কও আছে। ১৯২৭ সালে প্রতিষ্ঠিত, এখনো রমরমিয়ে চলছে। সমবায়ের উদ্যোক্তা রবীন্দ্রনাথ নিজে। তখনো বিশ্ববিদ্যালয় হয় নি। কিন্তু বিদ্যালয় ছিল আর ছিল আশ্রম। সেখানকার অধিবাসীরা যাতে সুষ্ঠু দামে সংসারের জরুরি জিনিষপত্র পেতে পারে সেই থেকে সমবায়ের ভাবনা। একই সময় থেকে শান্তিনিকেতনের আশে পাশের গ্রামগুলিতেও সমবায় তৈরির কাজ শুরু হয়। ১৯৬২ সালে যখন স্কুলে ভর্তি হচ্ছি তখন সমবায়টি আবার নতুন করে শুরু হচ্ছে, রবীন্দ্রনাথের মৃত্যুর পরে কিছুদিন অর্থাভাবে বন্ধ ছিল। বলা বাহুল্য তখন সমবায়ের মূল্য জানতাম না। পরে জানতে গিয়ে পড়তেই হয়েছে রবীন্দ্রনাথের সমবায় ভাবনা ও কাজের কথা। পড়তে হয়েছে তাঁর লেখা সেই পথিকৃৎ বই —
সমবায় নীতি
, The Cooperative Principle।
যাই হোক ১৯৬২ সালে পাঠভবনে ভর্তি হলাম। এই স্কুলটির তখন ৬১ বছর বয়স হয়ে গেছে। গাছ তলায় ক্লাস তখনো আছে। গোল হয়ে বসা একদিকে মেয়েরা একদিকে ছেলেরা। গোলের মাঝখানে দাদা বা দিদি। মানে শিক্ষক বা শিক্ষিকা। হ্যাঁ ছোটবেলা থেকেই তাঁদের অমুক দা তমুকদি বলে ডাকতাম। স্যার ম্যাম কথা দুটি প্রথম বাইশ বছরে শুনিনি। ফার্স্ট বেঞ্চ লাস্ট বেঞ্চ নেই, ভাল ছাত্ররা সামনে, গাধা ছাত্ররা পিছনে – এসব নেই। স্কুল ইউনিফর্ম নেই। আসন পেতে হাঁটু মুড়ে বসা, মাটিতে খাতা বই রেখে পড়াশোনা। এক গাছ তলা থেকে আরেক গাছ তলা। নিরঞ্জনদার বেদী থেকে নন্দিতাদির বেদি। একটু বড় হতে স্পষ্ট জেনেছিলাম ব্রিটিশদের তৈরি আধুনিক স্কুলের আদব কায়দা থেকে আলাদা শিক্ষা সংস্কৃতি তৈরির চেষ্টার অন্তর্গত ছিল এই সম্বোধন বা ক্লাসের গঠন। আমাদের ছোটবেলায় বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের উপাচার্য সুধীরঞ্জন দাস, তাকে সুধী দাদু বলে ডাকতাম, পরে উপাচার্য হলেন বিখ্যাত দার্শনিক কালিদাস ভট্টাচার্য। তাঁকে কালিদাসদা বলে ডাকতাম।
পর পর অনেকগুলি বিশাল গাছের ছায়ায় মোরাম দিয়ে আর ইটের বর্ডার দিয়ে ক্লাসের জন্য জায়গা তৈরি করা ছিল, মাঝখানে একটা সামান্য উঁচু বেদী, পাশে কাঠের স্ট্যান্ডে রাখা ব্ল্যাক বোর্ড। সারা স্কুল জীবন এই গাছ তলাতেই ক্লাস করেছি। বৃষ্টি হলে কয়েকটি বাড়ির বারান্দায় ক্লাস হত। বিজ্ঞানের ল্যাবরেটরি-র ক্লাস করতেই একমাত্র ঘর বন্দি হওয়া, নয়ত লাইব্রেরিতে। পাঠভবনে পড়ার বিষয়ের পাশাপাশি গানের ক্লাস ছিল আবশ্যক। স্কুলের গণ্ডি পেরোনো পর্যন্ত গানের ক্লাস আবশ্যক ছিল। গাছের তলায় বসে সীতাংশুদার গানের ক্লাসে আমরা একসঙ্গে সমস্বরে গান করতাম। বাংলা মিডিয়াম স্কুল কাজেই বাংলার উপর বিশেষ জোর ছিল। বেশির ভাগি রবীন্দ্রনাথের লেখা পড়তে হত। গদ্য এবং কবিতা দুইই। সেই স্কুলে থাকতেই
জীবনস্মৃতি
(রবীন্দ্রনাথের লেখা আত্মজীবনী) পড়েছি।
স্কুল জীবনে রবীন্দ্রনাথকে অনুভব করেছি নানা ভাবে। সকালের বৈতালিক (prayer), সন্ধ্যায় সাহিত্য সভা, দল বেধে রবীন্দ্রনাথের নাটক
মুকুট
,
ডাকঘর
,
ও অন্যান্য নাটক মঞ্চস্থ করা থেকে অনেক কিছু। রবীন্দ্রসঙ্গীত আমাদের জীবনের অঙ্গ ছিল। মনে আছে একটা গান শিখিয়েছিলেন গানের শিক্ষক সীতাংশুদা –
কাঁটা বন বিহারিণী
– আমরা কেউই বিশ্বাস করিনি এ গানটা রবীন্দ্রনাথের লেখা। বেসুরো একদল গাইয়েদের নিয়ে ব্যঙ্গ করে লেখা সে গান। বাড়ি এসে
গীতবিতান
খুলে খুঁজে খুঁজে বের করেছিলাম গানটি সত্যিই
গীতবিতানে
আছে কিনা।
বিশেষ আকর্ষণ ছিল প্রকৃতি পাঠ ক্লাসটি। আমাদের শিক্ষক বারিন দা বলতেন প্রকৃতির কাছ থেকে অনেক কিছু শেখার আছে, আর মনে রাখবে প্রকৃতি আছে বলে আমরা আছি। ওই ক্লাসেই তিনি  আমাদের দল বেঁধে নানা দিকে ঘুরতে নিয়ে যেতেন। গাছপালার নাম জেনেছি, পোকা মাকড় সম্পর্কে বুঝতে শিখেছি, নানা পশু পাখির চলাফেরা দেখতে শিখেছি। ভেলভেট পোকা বলে একটি পোকা আমাদের খুব প্রিয় ছিল। আমারা হাতের তালুতে তাকে নিতাম আবার ছেড়ে দিতাম। বারিন দা কোন পোকাকে কৌটো বন্দি করলে খুব রেগে যেতেন- বলতেন আমাদের মত ওদেরও স্বাধীন জীবন আছে।
রবীন্দ্রনাথ মনে করতেন মানুষের জীবন দু রকমের – একটা জীবন সে যাপন করে যার জন্য খেতে লাগে, লেখাপড়া লাগে, কামকাজ লাগে; আরেকটা জীবন সে ধারণ করে, সেই জীবনে সে গান গায়, ছবি আঁকে, অভিনয় করে, আনন্দে ভরিয়ে তোলে নিজেদের জীবন। জীবনকে পূর্ণ করতে দুটোই লাগে।
আমাদের স্কুল জীবনের শান্তিনিকেতনে ছিল বারো মাসে তেরো পার্বণ। নানা উৎসব অনুষ্ঠানে ভরা। পয়লা বৈশাখেই রবীন্দ্র জন্মদিন পালন করা হত। এই প্রথা রবীন্দ্রনাথের সময় থেকেই চলে আসছে। শান্তিনিকেতনে গরমকালে তীব্র গরম আর জলকষ্ট ছিল তাই ১লা মে থেকেই গরমের ছুটি পড়ে যেত, সে জন্য ১৪ই কি ১৫ই এপ্রিল পয়লা বৈশাখেই তাঁর জন্মদিন পালন করা হত। তা ছাড়া ছিল বসন্ত উৎসব, বর্ষা মঙ্গল, শারদোৎসব, বৃক্ষরোপণ, মাঘোৎসব, পৌষমেলা ইত্যাদি। এসবই আশ্রম জীবনের অঙ্গ ছিল। রবীন্দ্রনাথ মনে করতেন মানুষের জীবন দু রকমের – একটা জীবন সে যাপন করে যার জন্য খেতে লাগে, লেখাপড়া লাগে, কামকাজ লাগে; আরেকটা জীবন সে ধারণ করে, সেই জীবনে সে গান গায়, ছবি আঁকে, অভিনয় করে, আনন্দে ভরিয়ে তোলে নিজেদের জীবন। জীবনকে পূর্ণ করতে দুটোই লাগে। তাই আমাদের জীবনে লেখাপড়াও যেমন ছিল তার সঙ্গে ছিল আনন্দ উৎসবে ভরা শৈশব, আর কৈশোর। গান, নাটক, অভিনয়, লেখা আবৃত্তি, সাহিত্য সভা দিয়ে ভরা আনন্দময় জীবন।
আনন্দের সঙ্গে দায়িত্বও ছিল। নানা উৎসবে অনুষ্ঠানের সংগঠনের সঙ্গে জড়িয়ে থাকতাম আমরা। সাহিত্য সভা আয়োজন করা তো আমাদেরই কাজ ছিল। আমরাই জায়গা ঠিক করতাম, সভাপতিকে রাজি করাতাম, কে কোন লেখা পড়বে, আবৃত্তি করবে গান গাইবে ঠিক করতাম। যাতে দর্শক সমাগমে কমতি না হয়, তার চেষ্টা করতাম। ছাত্রদের পত্রিকা
​
‘
আমাদের লেখা’ বেরোতো প্রতি বছর। বড় ক্লাসে সেই পত্রিকার আয়োজনের সঙ্গে যুক্ত থেকেছি।
শান্তিনিকেতনের যদি সংস্কৃতির আর মানব মনের সাধনা হয়ে থাকে, তাহলে শ্রীনিকেতন হল দেশের ভবিষ্যতের সাধনা।
অষ্টম ক্লাসে যখন উঠেছি তখন বাবা বদলি হয়ে গেলেন শ্রীনিকেতনে। শান্তিনিকেতন থেকে প্রায় চার কিলোমিটার পশ্চিমে ১৯২২ সাল থেকে গড়ে উঠেছিল শ্রীনিকেতন। শান্তিনিকেতনের সঙ্গে তার অনেক তফাত। শান্তিনিকেতনের যদি সংস্কৃতির আর মানব মনের সাধনা হয়ে থাকে, তাহলে শ্রীনিকেতন হল দেশের ভবিষ্যতের সাধনা। এখানেই গড়ে উঠেছিল ডেয়ারি, কৃষি কলেজ, পল্লী সংগঠন বিভাগ, পল্লী চর্চা কেন্দ্র, শিল্প সদন ও রবীন্দ্রনাথের দ্বিতীয় স্কুল শিক্ষাসত্র। শ্রীনিকেতনে আমরা চার বছর ছিলাম। তখন এক অন্য রবীন্দ্রনাথের সঙ্গে পরিচয় ঘটল। একদিকে বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের পক্ষ থেকে ৩৯টি গ্রামে পল্লী উন্নয়নের কাজ হচ্ছে, গ্রামের ছেলেদের গ্রামীণ জীবনকে ঘিরে শিক্ষাক্রম তৈরি হয়েছে শিক্ষা সত্রে, একাধিক বৃত্তি শিক্ষার প্রশিক্ষণের জন্য আছে পল্লী চর্চা কেন্দ্র, শিল্প সদনে পুরুষ নারী ছেলে মেয়ে শিশুদের কাপড় জামা তৈরি শেখানো হচ্ছে আর তার বিক্রয় কেন্দ্র আছে। যেখানে থাকতাম তার গায়েই ছিল কৃষি কলেজ। রবীন্দ্রনাথের সময়ে কৃষি কলেজ ছিল না, কিন্তু কৃষির প্রশিক্ষণ হত শ্রীনিকেতনে।
এসবেরই শুরুয়াৎ হয়েছে ১৯২২ সালে রবীন্দ্রনাথেরই উদ্যোগে। শ্রীনিকেতনের নিজস্ব উৎসব ছিল হলকর্ষণ আর শ্রীনিকেতন মেলা। হলকর্ষণ বর্ষার চাষের শুরুর অনুষ্ঠান,  হত অগস্ট মাসে, আর শ্রীনিকেতন মেলা হত ফেব্রুয়ারি মাসে, যখন ফসল উঠেছে। স্কুলে পড়ার সময় এসবের মাহাত্ম্য অতটা বুঝিনি। তবে একেবারে বুঝিনি তাও নয়। ওই সময়েই পশ্চিমবঙ্গে নকশাল আন্দোলন শুরু হয়, ১৯৭০ সাল নাগাদ তা শান্তিনিকেতন শ্রীনিকেতনেও আসে, নকশালরা রবীন্দ্রনাথ বিদ্যাসাগর সবাইকেই আক্রমণ করে। তার আঁচ আমাদের গায়েও এসে লাগে। তখন একাধিক অনুষ্ঠানে বক্তারা রবীন্দ্রনাথের পল্লী ভাবনার মধ্যে যে রুপান্তরি চিন্তা ছিল তার কথা বলেন। সবটা না বুঝলেও আলগা আলগা বুঝতে পারছিলাম মতাদর্শের জগতে একটা বড় বিরোধ হচ্ছে। অনেক পরে বুঝেছি শহর সভ্যতার পাশাপাশি গ্রামকেও নিজের পায়ে দাঁড়ানোর স্বপ্ন থেকে তৈরি হয়েছিল শ্রীনিকেতন। যারা খবর রাখেন তাঁরা জানেন ১৯২৪ এর পর থেকে ক্রমশ রবীন্দ্রনাথও শ্রীনিকেতনের দিকে বিশেষ দৃষ্টি দেন, তিনি মনে করেছিলেন ভবিষ্যতের ভারতবর্ষ গড়তে গেলে তার রূপরেখাটি গ্রাম থেকেই তৈরি করতে হবে।
১৯৭১ সালে আমরা শান্তিনিকেতনে ফেরত চলে এলাম। তখন থেকে ১৯৭৭ এই ছয় বছর স্কুল কলেজে কাটানোর সুবাদে শান্তিনিকেতনে ছিলাম। তখন যুবা বয়সে রবীন্দ্রনাথকে একটু ভালো করে বোঝার সুযোগ হয়,
চণ্ডালিকা
চিত্রাঙ্গদা
নাটক তো শিশু বয়স থেকে দেখে আসছি, কিন্তু সে নাটকের গভীর সামাজিক মেসেজ বুঝতে পেরেছি সেই সময়ে। একই সময়ে
রক্তকরবী
নাটকটি অনুষ্ঠিত হয়, সেই নাটক আমায় ভীষণভাবে নাড়া দিয়েছিল। সেই প্রথম একনায়কতন্ত্রের স্বরূপটি দেখতে পেয়েছিলাম। সেই সময় রবীন্দ্রনাথের দুটি উপন্যাস পড়ার সুযোগ হয়,
গোরা
আর
ঘরে বাইরে
, আর কিছু ছোট গল্প। উপন্যাস দুটিই স্বদেশী আইডিয়াকে ঘিরে লেখা। ওই একই সময়ে গান্ধী ও রবীন্দ্রনাথের মধ্যেকার মতাদর্শের বিরোধের কথা প্রথম শুনতে পাই। যদি অনেক পরে, সব্যসাচীদার (সব্যসাচী ভট্টাচার্য) লেখা বইটি এই বিষয়ে বিস্তৃত আলোকপাত করে।
১৯৭৭ সালে শান্তিনিকেতন থেকে উচ্চ শিক্ষার্থে অন্যত্র চলে যাই, কিন্তু রবীন্দ্রনাথের সংস্পর্শ ত্যাগ করিনি। গান গাইতে হলে গলায় এখনো রবীন্দ্রসংগীতই আসে, আমার পড়ানোর সূত্রে রবীন্দ্রনাথ বার বার ফিরে ফিরে আসেন সমবায়ের সূত্রে, পল্লী উন্নয়নের সূত্রে, অন্য শিক্ষা ব্যবস্থার সূত্রে। আজকে জাতীয়তাবাদের যে রূপ দেখতে পাই সেই রূপটি বিষয়ে ১৯১৬ সালে লেখা রবীন্দ্রনাথের সাবধানবানী আমার এখনো পাথেয়। বসন্ত উৎসব বর্ষামঙ্গল, শারদোৎসব ইত্যাদিকে ঘিরে সেকুলার উৎসব তথা মানব মিলনের যে ধারা রবীন্দ্রনাথ আমাদের দিয়ে গেছেন, আজকের বিকৃত ধার্মিক সংস্কৃতির বিকল্প হিসেবে তার মূল্য যে কতখানি তা বলার নয়। আর আজকের শিক্ষার সংকটের এই দুর্দিনে শুধু মনে হয় আমরা কতখানি ভাগ্যবান যে শান্তিনিকেতন শ্রীনিকেতনে থাকার ও পড়ার সুযোগ পেয়েছি। আর হ্যাঁ যে কথাটা আজ বড্ড ফ্যাশন হয়ে গেছে – পরিবেশ- সেই চেতনারও আমাদের কাছে একটাই উৎস, রবীন্দ্রনাথ।
লেখক সম্পর্কে
অশোক সরকারের স্কুল ও কলেজ জীবন কেটেছিল শান্তিনিকেতনে ১৯৬০ ও ৭০-এর দশকে। তাঁর পিতামাতা জীবনের ৭০ সাল শান্তিনিকেতনে কাটিয়েছেন, সেই সুবাদে পরবর্তী ৪০ বছর ধরে অশোকের শান্তিনিকেতনের সঙ্গে নিবিড় যোগাযোগ। গত ১৪ বছর ধরে অশোক আজিম প্রেমজি বিশ্ববিদ্যালয়ের অধ্যাপক। এক সহ লেখকের সঙ্গে লেখা তাঁর বই কবির পাঠশালাঃ পাঠভবন ও শিক্ষাসত্রের ইতিহাস ও তার ইংরেজি অনুবাদ The Poet’s School: The History of Patha Bhavan and Sikshasatra, রবীন্দ্রনাথের হাতে গড়া দুই বিকল্প শিক্ষা প্রতিষ্ঠানের প্রাতিষ্ঠানিক ইতিহাসের প্রামাণ্য কাহিনী।

Unravelling Womanhood: Insights from Personal Reflection
On International Women’s Day,
Sonika Parashar
, through a chance conversation and collaborative reflection,
underlines the important role schooling, teachers and peer groups play in shaping a child’s gender identity and sense of self.
Art: Amplifying Voices by Avinash Karn and Thara M Thomas
A chance conversation one morning with one of my female colleagues at Azim Premji University led us to talk about how both of us had very different parenting and schooling experiences while growing up. Yet, as we turned into adolescents and then young adults, we seemed to have developed similar ideas about what it meant to be a woman.
Now when we look back, as girls and women in the age group of 11 – 23 years, we had very low self-esteem. We did not consider ourselves worthy enough to be in a relationship that valued us for who we were, for what we brought to the table, and for what we could be. We seemed to be adjusting for the most part to the expectations others put on us, not understanding in the process how certain relationships had turned toxic for us.
Before this conversation, I believed that I had a negative view of myself as a woman because of my childhood experiences. This included growing up in a highly patriarchal household, and a schooling environment no different from other mainstream schools of the time, which taught us to conform.
I knew my colleague and her background well enough to be aware that her parents and the
​
‘
alternative’ school environment had always encouraged her to voice her opinion and hold her individuality strongly.
On the other hand, when I was growing up, I was asked to behave in certain stereotypical ways expected of a woman — being submissive to others and keeping family first (also read as cooking, cleaning, nurturing in preparation for a
​
‘
suitable’ husband and in-laws) over career and personal ideologies.
It surprised me that despite the differences in our general upbringing at home, and the different kinds of schools we went to in terms of vision, curriculum and pedagogy, both of us grew up to unconsciously have similar beliefs about what it meant to be a woman. We felt that the best we, as women deserved in a relationship, was someone who
said
they loved or cared for us, even if their
actions
were more attuned to loving themselves instead of us.
How did this happen, I wondered.
In terms of the
school
being an important pillar of socialisation in a child’s life, even when we came from two entirely different school backgrounds — one being
​
‘
mainstream’ and the other being
​
‘
alternative’, we felt it had a similar impact on us. My colleague feels her peer group was a stronger influence than her home environment in making her see herself in a certain way, leading to her feeling disempowered over the years.
I too had had a similar experience where, as an adolescent, I had started looking at myself through my peers’ eyes — not always kind. The home environment only worsened the situation for me. So, our
peer groups
in our respective schools were identified as one similar factor influencing our sense of self as girls/​women.
We then concurred that both of us had
teachers
who made us and who swayed us, the ones who made us believe in ourselves and the ones who taught us to oblige no matter what. With an already depleting sense of self-worth, it seemed we were listening more to the ones who were asking us to submit and conform without appreciating what we truly wanted as girls/​women.
The third factor that we also discussed briefly was the
media
we were exposed to. It romanticised and glorified, even if toxic, the notion of what it meant to be a woman. She was sacrificing, empathetic, kind, submissive, loving, selfless — qualities stereotypically associated with
​
‘
good’ women.
We felt it was our
​
‘
duty’ to
​
‘
save the people’ in our lives. It didn’t matter if a male friend or partner acted like a toxic
Kabir Singh
(character in a Hindi film). We believed it was us who were destined to transform their lives and save them from themselves by steadily loving and nurturing them even if it meant putting up with their adult tantrums, at the cost of our well-being.
Today as a grown-up woman, and a new mother to a girl, I know better. I know that how I look at myself is all that matters. Also, it is important to have clarity in thought and follow someone only if you are convinced by their ideas. Otherwise, one should build the courage and confidence to tread one’s path.
I know now that it should not be anybody’s
​
‘
duty’ to
​
‘
save’ the other. As adults, we should build ourselves and sort out our mess ourselves. We should take help and support but should not make others responsible for who we are — we should be held accountable for ourselves. I know all of this today; however, I wish I knew it when I needed it the most — during my adolescence and young adult years.
The chance conversation and collaborative reflection with my colleague pushed me to once again underline the important role schooling, teachers and peer groups play in a child’s life.
On this
Women’s Day
, I raise some questions for myself and anybody interested:
How do we create school spaces that encourage a positive sense of self in children of all genders?
What can support adolescents and young adults in navigating issues related to their gender identity?
As teachers and teacher-educators, what systems can we create, and which practices can we employ to frame a space that allows children to express themselves and empathise with others — especially in relation to issues of gender identity?
How can we empower children and young adults in a way that that helps them navigate the labyrinth created by peer groups and the media?
Will I be able to teach my daughter all that I know today as a woman? Will I be able to counter the negativity from some peers, teachers and the media?
Though I do not know the answers yet, I will try my best. Perhaps working on the questions that I have raised here will help.

Mother-Tongue Education is Key for Indigenous Languages
Anvita Abbi
, in conversation with
A Giridhar Rao
at the
Hyderabad Literary Festival (
HLF
2024)
, highlights how Indigenous languages show us unique ways of being human.
At the just-concluded Hyderabad Literary Festival (
HLF
) poets and linguists emphasised that the mother tongue must be the medium of instruction in school. They argued that this is especially important for Indigenous children. The task is an urgent one for speakers of Endangered languages.
This post briefly reports on one
HLF
session — my conversation with Professor
Anvita Abbi
.
The 14th edition of HLF (26–28 January 2024) included:
250
speakers
150
events
15
streams
HLF
2024 introduced a new stream,
​
“
Indigenous and Endangered Languages” (
IEL
). As the concept note clarifies,
​
“
This is in alignment with the United Nations which has declared 2022 – 2032
​
“
International Decade of Indigenous Languages
”. Optimistic estimates suggest that at least 50 percent of today’s spoken languages will be extinct or seriously endangered by 2100. Most of these are Indigenous languages.”
Indigenous poets, storytellers, writers, artists, folklorists, and researchers participated in this year’s
IEL
stream. Sessions included children’s stories, poetry, panel discussions by experts, and even a workshop on Gondi art. Some of the Indigenous languages represented were the
Great Andamanese languages
,
Gondi
,
Jarawa
,
Kui
,
Lambadi
,
Onge
,
Oraon
,
Santali
, and
Toda
.
Among the prominent speakers was Professor Anvita Abbi. She spoke of her engagement over several decades with minority languages of South Asia, especially the languages of the Andaman and Nicobar islands.
She said that linguistic and genetic evidence have converged to confirm that these ethnic groups are descendants of some of the earliest human groups to leave Africa, perhaps 50,000 years ago. This led her to describe
historical linguistics as a
​
“
forensic science” which uncovers the past!
United Nations has declared 2022 – 2032 as the
International Decade of Indigenous Languages
. Optimistic estimates suggest that at least 50 percent of today’s spoken languages will be extinct or seriously endangered by 2100. Most of these are Indigenous languages.
Professor Abbi shared some fascinating details about the syntax and semantics of Great Andamanese.
She observed that the structure of the Great Andamanese languages derives from a conceptual division of the human body into seven zones. Each zone has a linguistic marker. As she clarified in a 2023-
article
in
Scientific American
on this subject:
The markers… derived from seven zones of the body and were attached to a root word, usually as a prefix, to describe concepts such as
​
“
inside,”
​
“
outside,”
​
“
upper” and
​
“
lower.” For example, the morpheme
er
-, which qualified most anything having to do with an outer body part, could be stuck to -
cho
to yield
ercho
, meaning
​
“
head.” A pig’s head was thus
raercho
[
ra
means
​
“
pig”].…
Important, too, was the morpheme
a
-, which referred to the mouth and, more broadly, to origins. It contributed to the nouns
aphong
, for

The title of her article summarises the argument:
This Ancient Language has the Only Grammar Based Entirely on the Human Body
. But, as she movingly notes, these fascinating languages face extinction:
Of the roughly 7,000 languages spoken by humans today, half will fall silent by the end of this century. Survival in an era of globalisation, urbanisation and climate change forces Indigenous communities to replace their traditional ways of life and languages with those of the dominant society. When the older generation can no longer teach the tongue to the younger ones, a language is doomed. And with every language lost, we lose a wealth of knowledge about human existence, perception, nature and survival.
She noted that these spoken languages are considered
​
“
primitive” and given no importance in school education. Her proposal for
​
“
urgent course correction” included early childhood education in the mother tongue (a recommendation that animates our courses at Azim Premji University).
Other poets and researchers at

Damayanti Beshra
,
Bhangya Bhukya
,
Ganesh Devy
,
Jacinta Kerketta
, and
Karthick Narayanan
among others — all noted the many dimensions along which Indigenous and Endangered Languages and their speakers need urgent help. However, several of them also argued that the medium of instruction in school plays a critical role in the flourishing of the mother tongue.
Only then will these unique ways of being human be passed on to the next generation.

Interrogating Meritocracy
Aashti Salman
says that the discourse of merit
​
“
smooths over structural inequalities, keeping everyone on an ostensibly equal playing field”.
In modern societies, it is widely acknowledged that individuals have more opportunities to pursue their career goals and achieve the life that they desire. This means that if a person is born into a family of cobblers, they can still aspire to become an astronaut. Modern societies would provide the necessary opportunities for the person to achieve this aspiration. The upward social mobility, transitioning from one class position (cobbler) to the achieved class position (astronaut) is facilitated through education.
According to several Western sociologists, associated with the functionalist perspective, schools in modern society play a positive and significant role, by imparting the skills that would enable pupils to participate efficiently in the modern economy.
Mass schooling emerged in capitalist western societies to make primary and middle schooling accessible, regardless of the background of the pupils. Public schools were designed with a standardised curriculum and students were assessed based on their performance in examinations, which would demonstrate their acquired skills. Several countries in the Global South, such as India, adopted this system of schooling.
Merit would be the criteria through which coveted positions would be awarded to those individuals who
​
‘
excelled’ in schooling and subsequently in higher education. Taking the example of the child of the cobbler, a functionalist would show that the child be provided schooling opportunities and the space to prove their abilities through assessment. If the child is sufficiently meritorious, then they could pursue a career as an astronaut. However, if they fail to demonstrate their potential in terms of merit, then they would not be worthy of becoming one.
Such a system, functionalists believe, facilitates the move from a society where social mobility is based on ascribed status (inherited advantages at birth, such as caste, class, religion, gender, region, and so on) to achieved status (what the child achieves through meritorious performance).
If the functionalist argument were indeed valid, one might expect to observe significantly high levels of upward social mobility in most countries. But this has not been the case.
For instance, in India, research indicates that social mobility, as defined in terms of movement from one social class to another, has shown a tendency to be stable on average (Vaid, 2018). This suggests that social class inequalities are persistent, as those who seek mobility from the lower to upper classes find limited opportunities to do so.
We therefore have another plausible argument at hand where we need to disentangle the concept of merit. This has been done by several social scientists, for instance by the ones who could be placed in the Marxist and Neo-Marxist traditions (see Feinberg and Jonas, 2009). These social scientists argue that merit is simply a tool to legitimise inequalities in society. Under capitalist societies, such as India, economic inequalities are not diminishing.
For instance, a recent study shows that wealth inequalities in independent India fell till the 1980s, after which they started rising, to attain an all-time high in contemporary times.
1
The paper shows that income and wealth inequalities are higher in contemporary India than they were during colonial times. In addition to wealth inequalities, India remains a highly unequal society, with caste,
2
regional (Dreze and Sen, 2013) religious (
GOI
, 2006), and gender-based inequalities,
3
to name a few.
Now, how do we justify such inequalities? Would not the marginalised simply scrutinise the advantages of the rich and hold them accountable? One explanation is that the school curriculum and practices promote the ideology of merit. Students are taught that they should excel in assessments, with the promise that doing so would enable them to achieve their desired path.
Moreover, the responsibility for academic success largely falls on the students, as teachers can provide limited focus to each student. Consequently, private resources are essential for students. These resources are required to be directed towards education, encompassing access to high-quality schools (and universities), private tuitions, to complement regular instruction, and so on.
We know that only a privileged minority can access quality private schooling in India, leaving the others to attend subpar private and public schools. The chances of moving into higher quality colleges and universities are readily available, similarly, to that privileged minority.
The argument extends to suggesting that students who fail to prove themselves in assessments are individually responsible for their inability to achieve their aspirations. The ones who attain successful careers and wield influence have earned their right place in society by proving their worth via merit. Consequently, merit is depicted as an inherent trait possessed by certain individuals, granting them rightful status within society.
During my MPhil fieldwork, I worked with low-income Muslim men who had discontinued secondary school for various reasons. I aimed to find out what these reasons were. I found that the primary reason for dropping out was their firm belief that their lack of interest in school education contributed to their dropout. They attributed this lack of interest to their inability to engage in
​
“
hard work” during their school years.
There was a significant emphasis placed on the value of hard work, with many men regarding this as the only path to a successful and fulfilling life. They fervently believed that individuals from lower-class backgrounds had an equal or higher chance of completing school compared to individuals from upper-class backgrounds. Most of the men also firmly believed that regardless of religious identity, young men in Delhi had equal chances for educational success.
However, when looking at all-India data for reasons for dropout for Muslim men through an analysis of the 71
st
round of National Sample Survey Office (
NSSO
) data, I found that the most important factors were financial constraints and engagement in economic activities.
In India, research indicates that social mobility, as defined in terms of movement from one social class to another, has shown a tendency to be stable on average, which suggests that social class inequalities are persistent, as those who seek mobility from the lower to upper classes find limited opportunities to do so.
In my PhD, which built upon some of the themes from my M Phil, I interviewed a respondent named Hashim
4
who strongly believed in the ideology of merit. Hashim belonged to a socio-economically vulnerable background. Due to various health issues his parents ceased to work, which forced Hashim to migrate to Delhi with his older brothers, to work loading and unloading vegetables at a wholesale market.
Despite these challenges, Hashim’s efforts paid off as he was placed in touch with a neighbourhood
NGO
, working with vulnerable youth. This
NGO
facilitated his schooling through bridge courses. The
NGO
also assisted Hashim with admission to Delhi University for an undergraduate degree and later to Indira Gandhi National Open University, Delhi for his post-graduation.
Involved in mentoring at-risk youth at the
NGO
, Hashim found inspiration from his life and the few success stories of youth like him. This made him gain confidence and optimism about his future, keeping hope for a better life alive.
Through his affiliation with the
NGO
and Delhi University, Hashim gained social networks and cultural capital that fueled his aspiration to become a professor. In 2020, he was preparing for admission into PhD courses at Jawaharlal Nehru University.
While Hashim’s story is emblematic of upward social mobility through high aspirations, he endured debilitating hardships as he continued to be a full-time labourer during his school and college education. This would give him only a few hours of sleep and almost no time to study, but he believed the effort worthwhile.
Extreme disciplining of the self through regulation and deprivation spelled hard work for youth such as Hashim. Youth like Hashim, therefore, firmly believe that hard work and meritocracy are the only routes to upward mobility in contemporary times.
Youth like Hashim had the support of the
NGO
whose members continue to mentor him. What about others like Hashim for whom supportive networks and resources are absent?
Extreme disciplining of the self through regulation and deprivation spelled hard work for youth such as Hashim (a respondent interviewed by the author) who firmly believe that hard work and meritocracy are the only routes to upward mobility in contemporary times.
Now consider the cobbler’s child once again. They want to become an astronaut but so does the child of the doctor who stays in the posh building across the road from where the cobbler sits. Assume there is only one seat available in a prestigious institution of higher learning. Can we truly compare the resources available to these two children to help them to eventually access this institution?
The answer to that would likely be no. Now, in addition to the economic disadvantage of the cobbler’s child, they may also belong to a historically marginalised caste.
Additionally, they may also have to work after school hours, contributing to their meagre family income. These intersecting disadvantages faced by the cobbler’s child may compound their challenges. Let us also assume that the doctor’s child belongs to a caste that has historically held several socio-economic advantages. Their caste can then be used as a resource or capital, which gives the child distinct advantages over and above their social class (being a doctor’s child). The class and caste capital would compound to provide a significant competitive edge to the doctor’s child over the cobbler’s child.
This finding has grounds in empirical work, as Ajantha Subramaniam (2019) argues in the context of the Indian Institute of Technology (
IIT
) Madras. Her study shows that for several generations, the caste composition of the students at
IIT
has largely been upper caste.
She highlights how upper castes have converted their caste resources, or inherited privileges associated with hailing from an upper caste background, into a supposedly innate competence over others, to enter
IIT
Madras through competitive examinations. This innate competence is grounded in the abstract concept of merit.
Merit smooths over structural inequalities, keeping everyone on an ostensibly equal playing field. There are inherent flaws and contradictions within the system of meritocracy which we must remain cognisant of even when we celebrate its success within contemporary society.

The Allure of Self-Diagnosis of Attention Disorders
Bhuvaneswari B
, drawing from her extensive experience as both a professional clinician and a teacher, emphasises the critical importance of obtaining a proper diagnosis.
My experience with individuals diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (
ADHD
) began more than twenty years ago during my days as a student clinician. During that time, I worked with children, adolescents and adults experiencing speech, language, and hearing challenges. My understanding of
ADHD
was limited to theoretical knowledge that I gained through interactions with my professors and with children diagnosed with
ADHD
.
It wasn’t until 2007 that I began working closely with children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders (
ASD
), Learning Disabilities (
LD
), and
ADHD
. In some instances, I also worked with children with hearing impairment, intellectual disability, Specific Language Impairment (
SLI
), Developmental Apraxia of Speech (
CAS
), stuttering, cleft lip and palate, and such conditions.
My most impactful experience was with Kiran (name changed), a child with
ADHD
at an institute of speech and hearing in South India, where he attended therapy sessions.
​
“
Tsunami Kiran”, as we would affectionately call him, would burst into the group therapy room like a tsunami and his endless energy would exhaust us. He was an
​
“
explosive child
” as Ross Greene would describe him — a child who seemed easily frustrated and was very inflexible. Getting him to work on any activity was a challenge, but he made significant progress as he started getting comfortable with the group (a peer group of 5 children with similar or related characteristics) and the routine of the therapy sessions. He had endearing ways to avoid tasks but slowly found the motivation to complete the tasks assigned. It was both challenging and enjoyable to work with him.
Apart from working with children like Kiran, I was also teaching courses in Speech Language Therapy at the same institute. Thus, my professional life was balanced between teaching future therapists and working with individuals facing various communication difficulties, including language loss post-stroke, stammering, voice disorders, and various developmental disabilities.
As a clinician and teacher, I was able to support second- and third-year students of Speech Language Therapy and Audiology in their courses. A lot of this was possible because of my clinical experiences with children, adolescents and adults with various communication difficulties which served as ready references while teaching.
Beginning 2013, when I set up a centre for children with special needs, my focus shifted to supporting children with various developmental disabilities and learning disabilities. During this time, I also taught courses on clinical linguistics and allied courses of speech language therapy to postgraduate students at the institute of speech and hearing, but none of them really had identified themselves as neurodivergent.
When I joined Azim Premji University in 2021, I began interacting more with neurodiverse adults on campus. Some had formal diagnoses from their school years, while others came to me with a self-diagnosis of
ADHD
. While I was empathetic towards their self-identification, and did not want to invalidate their feelings, I was also concerned, as I was well aware of the perils of self-diagnosis. This is when the University promptly referred them for detailed evaluation and diagnosis. It was a relief because
ADHD
is a multifaceted condition and cannot be oversimplified to hyperactivity or inattention.
Despite increased awareness and testing leading to a rise in
ADHD
diagnoses, the trend of self-diagnosis is concerning. Professor Joseph Davis at University of Virginia calls it
​
“
personal appropriation” rather than
​
“
self-diagnosis,” emphasising that a diagnosis should follow a medical examination by a qualified professional.
Personal experiences, especially with mental health concerns, seem to be very influential on social media, and it is perhaps why many young adults try to identify themselves with a mental health condition or a neurodiverse condition like
ADHD
(although this may not always be true).
Bhuvaneswari B
Since ADHD-like characteristics may be caused by other factors such as stress, medical practitioners and mental health professionals need to rule out these factors during diagnosis. While overdiagnoses and misdiagnoses are prevalent, there are also adults who get diagnosed only late in life, thus giving an official name to their unknown struggles. It is noteworthy that without proper diagnosis and management,
ADHD
can lead to other mental health conditions like anxiety, depression or other issues such as substance abuse.
Oftentimes,
ADHD
is not clearly understood by the general public. Misconceptions about
ADHD
are also reinforced by stereotypes perpetuated by social media, which has in the past led to the popularisation of many mental health conditions.
Personal experiences, especially with mental health concerns, seem to be very influential on social media, and this is perhaps why many young adults try to identify themselves with a mental health condition or a neurodiverse condition like
ADHD
(although this may not always be true). For university students, being identified with such a condition may bring some relief in the form of academic accommodations. Such intentions of young adults complicate the general understanding of this condition and stigmatise those genuinely affected by
ADHD
.
ADHD
is a clinical condition that may require expert medical intervention, and in some cases, a recommendation for medication. These recommendations are precise and calculated and need to be followed strictly.
ADHD
involves a spectrum of issues, including challenges with executive function, impulse control, attentional issues (impacting learning), and emotional regulation. These need confirmation by a qualified mental health professional and a licensed medical practitioner. Once confirmed, whether medication is prescribed or not, persons with
ADHD
will benefit from structured intervention sessions. For instance, I worked with a student who had a formal diagnosis, focusing on enhancing their executive functions through goal-setting, monitoring goals, using metacognitive strategies, self-evaluation of progress, task analysis, and time management, outside of their class hours.
Understanding and addressing
ADHD
requires a nuanced approach, recognising the various layers of its complexity and the necessity for professional diagnosis and intervention. It is crucial to address these concerns with sensitivity, ensuring that those genuinely affected receive the support they need while also ensuring a responsible discourse around mental health.

Tagore, education and nationalism: seeking the unfragmented world
Amman Madan
on how Tagore saw India’s contribution to the moral development of humanity
Like many other Indians I had had to memorize Rabindranath Tagore’s poem
​
“
Where the mind is without fear
” in school. And like them I, too, began to understand it only when I came into my twenties. I say
​
“
began” for even today I find new meanings in it.
Tagore stands at the cross-roads of many questions with which we Indians struggle even today – How do children or grownups learn? What is the place of love or anger in our lives? What is the nation or, for that matter, what is the spiritual? What are the most important things worth learning? Tagore’s writings give much food for thought, even if I cannot always agree with him. I think this white-bearded man would not have minded my disagreements. He was after all the man who rejected our tradition of social ostracism for those who thought differently. He himself took traditions quite seriously and looked deep into them to search for the truth of India, not as a unique land by itself, but as its contribution to a larger truth of humanity. But he was vocal in his opposition to
​
“
the blind and lazy habit of relying upon the authority of traditions that are incongruous anachronisms in the present age” (Tagore 1921, p 114). Blind agreement was something he firmly opposed.
The search for
​
“
truth,” which was what he and Gandhi tended to call their search for the best cultural norms, could not be content with the most obvious answers. He wrote that people learned from their experiences and that deprivation might teach one to become a thief. This was the obvious answer and many accepted it. But humans did not stop at just that lesson. There was something within humans, which led them to higher ideals. They learned to overcome deprivation not by theft but by sharing and by love.
In a stark warning against immediate reactions and the habit of taking the easiest path Tagore pointed out that all civilization
rested on love
and care for others. If humans had just taken the easy path, they would have never achieved the greatness of art, culture and industry which we see today. My economist friends would join me in smiling at this early rejection of the rational economic actor, who once dominated their discipline. At one point of time more and more economists thought that individuals always tried to increase their benefits and minimize their costs. Tagore, however, said that being human was about being moral and about social cooperation. Of course, we had a political and an economic side to us, but the key to being human was our moral side.
Tagore gave a sharp warning to the world of his times, one which we will benefit from heeding even today. He said the West had had few resources and so learned to build strong groups which preyed on each other. They learned more effective ways of making war and so captured the lands of those who had not felt the need to become as predatory as them. The greed for more and more things motivated the improvement of industry and led to an outpouring of goods. This, he said, accelerated into modern times and came together in the form of the
​
“
Nation” which was present in many countries. The Nation was a pattern in humans to concentrate political and economic strengths into one organization and then push all the people to become mindless cogs in its machines. India did not have such a Nation and had come under the heel of the military and material power of the form it had taken in Britain.
Tagore was clear that such a concentration of power and materialism was not the same as Western civilization. He said that in its heart the West too understood, like Indians, that the most important principles for humanity had to be moral and not political or economic. But it was getting increasingly swamped by the latter. As the moral got more and more distant from politics and production, the problems of countries increased. They sought to overcome the problems by even more politics and more production.
Greater production was a wonderful thing, he agreed. It saved people from starvation and drudgery. The rise of the rule of law, too, was a great improvement which the West had wrought. This leap in politics suppressed the whimsical acts of kings and tyrants. Tagore insisted that he was a great admirer of Western civilization. That was why he urged them to not allow their higher selves to get drowned under the mindlessness of factory work and the ever-increasing control and surveillance of their citizens.
When I read Tagore after reading Critical Theory I feel a twinge of shame about our habit of reading only Western scholars and not Indians. Yes, there is much that Tagore misses. But there is also much that he says (see, for instance, Tagore 1921, 1961) that Critical Theory misses.
India was captivated by the razzle-dazzle of its conquerors, Tagore reminds me. It ignored its own true self to think that by copying the conquerors it would rise up and become like them. But this led only to becoming another mirror image of the same aggressive, selfish countries, with pretensions of ethics while always scheming to get the better of others. This could never take humans very far. They had to find ways of living in a more cooperative way with others, not in a more competitive way. They had to find ways of living with love for their neighbours, not hatred and jealousy.
India had historically paid attention more to the social rather than the political and economic. And this was actually the most important dimension of the three, Tagore felt.
​
“
The truth is that the spirit of conflict and conquest is at the origin and in the centre of Western nationalism; its basis is not social cooperation. It has evolved a perfect organization of power, but not spiritual idealism” (ibid. p 21). The most important challenge in the world then and now was what to do about different social groups (Tagore used the archaic and now rejected term
​
“
races”) who were increasingly coming into close contact with each other. He said that, unlike the West, India had paid more attention to the problem of social life and experimented upon it more extensively than others, even if it had not found a perfect solution. It was a sign of its advancement that all the different social groups which came into India down the years became its own. The British too would become India’s own (after all, which language are you reading this in?). This acceptance and re-arranging was India’s contribution to the moral development of the whole of humanity.
One of India’s attempted solutions to the problem of social relations which ultimately failed, Tagore said, was the caste system. It failed because it forced large numbers of people to live in humiliation and prevented them from following their talents and passions in work, holding them back instead into their ancestral occupations. Another of its attempted solutions was the poetry of
Nanak
,
Kabir
and
Chaitanya
, which taught people to love the same God, each in their different way.
Humanity faced many challenges in its search for the perfect harmony of elements, Tagore believed. India in its own way was carrying forward that common search of all humanity. But when it began to imitate its conquerors it became untrue to itself and fell downward into the path of hatred and never-ending strife between social groups.
Tagore thought to be lazy those who declared that India had found all its answers millenia ago and all we had to now do was to publicize them. The journey was yet unfinished. His trenchant critique of what later scholars called the state and modernity drew him to learning about and spreading a better harmony between humans and nature as well as harmony between the moral, the social, the political and the economic. The way forward for him was to build institutions where people created and learned this new harmony. Education for Tagore became as necessary as his writing.
Tagore’s views on education (see Jha 1994 for a short overview of his many writings and lectures on education) were closely linked to his views on western and Indian civilizations, harmony between humans and nature and the importance of cooperation between social groups for human progress. Like many educationists before him –
Rousseau
,
Montessori
,
Froebel
and so on – Tagore believed that the education of children had to be different from that of adults. Children were to be taught through directly experiencing life and nature. Playing with colours, words, objects they would gradually move to a more abstracted contemplation of their existence. It was important to teach how to work in offices and to have an ascetic immersion in learning. But that should come later, he believed.
The education of all – children as well as grownups – should include what was essentially human and also what was essential to an Indian voice in humanity. If we ignored this then the disharmony created would eventually come back to bite us. Pupils in schools as well as universities should learn that politics and industry were important, but being human they had to learn to give priority to the moral over all else. This was a sharp contrast with today’s fear-ridden rush towards coaching centres, where the terror of being left out of the market drives away all other life choices. This, Tagore would have felt, was our continued submission to the violence of the market over the moral. No wonder that there were so many tragic suicides or that the majority of young people were left scarred and angry by their school and college experiences.
Tagore believed that the greatest search and striving within Indian civilization was about how different social groups could live with each other in harmony and justice. Education had to play a big role in this, teaching children and adults how to cooperate with each other, rather than compete. Classrooms and assessments should be about learning to listen, reflect and create and especially about learning to collaborate with others. He would have been puzzled and horrified at how today’s schools teach students to enjoy getting two marks more than their friends. When we see organizations, political parties and countries teaching youth to spout hatred against others he would have said that this was the result of our copying the violent cultures of the exploitative, materialistic Nation rather than seeing what Indian culture was.
The education Tagore dreamt of and the institutions he set up always tried to do a critical selection from Indian culture and tried to integrate it with what was admirable in other countries. He began to cultivate vernacular languages in schools and universities, as a way to connect the lives and thoughts of ordinary people with the elites. He believed that the knowledge taught in universities should be of relevance to farmers and artisans, not just educated babus. Tagore searched far and wide for teachers who could teach such knowledges, for instance who could add the lessons of modern science to the best in traditional Indian agriculture while also giving due primacy to the spiritual, the moral and the aesthetic in agriculture. The beauty of rice fields at dawn could inspire learning to cooperate with each other and scientifically discover better cultivation methods. Young people began to understand that social relations were reinvented when they brought fragmented landholdings into cooperative farms. This movement away from relations between landlords and tenants was seen as a step towards a greater proximity with the divine. This broke in several ways with how other Indian and western universities were built.
Tagore was far from satisfied with the results of his experiments in education. After all his ambition was not a small one: it meant not only identifying the best from Indian traditions but learning from other sources, too, so as to make headway in the great challenges humanity faces – how can different communities live together in close proximity with peace and justice, how to produce in a sustainable way which meets needs but does not fuel greed and jealousy, how to govern ourselves so that justice and freedom prevails, amongst others. Indian educational institutions have a long way to go before we approach his vision.
I was in my late twenties when I read Tagore’s lecture
​
“
My school
”. I was wondering at that time what to do with my life. It had to have something to do with education, I knew, since this was the path through which people had to pass if they were to get over hatred, injustice and oppression. It was electrifying then to read the opening lines of his lecture:
“
I started a school in Bengal when I was nearing forty. Certainly this was never expected of me, who had spent the greater portion of my life in writing, chiefly verses. Therefore people naturally thought that as a school it might not be one of the best of its kind, but it was sure to be something outrageously new, being the product of daring inexperience.”
Here was a great poet who dared to think about education, that domain which the Indian middle classes held in silent contempt. And he was willing to change directions, make mistakes, by taking leaps into exciting new terrains.
I admire a lot in Tagore and I also note the many gaps in his thought. There are some things which I don’t understand, like his talk about the spiritual. There are some things which we now reject like his talk about races and the universal man and his teleological ethics. Nonetheless over the years I have shared that lecture of Tagore’s with hundreds of my students, it helped us to together imagine that other kinds of schools were indeed possible. There could be a school where climbing a tree was as important as reading a book. Where love was the central principle of learning, not competition or showing the others down. Education deserved to be thought about very seriously and never to be reduced to the cramming of dry words and paper, something which he raged against in his
​
“
The Parrot’s training
”.
I see his ideals and that of many other scholars and realise that we have a long way to go yet. With him and the others, I see that cooperation and paying attention to our moral dimension is indeed the answer through which humanity can continue to improve upon itself. And if sometimes one has to break from the rest in order to nudge them forward, then

To the Moon and Beyond
Proteep Mallik
wonders about the many aspects of our celestial neighbour on
International Moon Day
The Moon, as seen through the Azim Premji University 200mm diameter Dobsonian reflecting telescope.
“
Wow! There are so many craters!”, gasped the student while her eyes were glued to the eyepiece. It was a crisp moonlit night and dozens of students were gathered on the roof of one of the buildings on the Azim Premji University, Bengaluru campus, to explore the sky through the 200mm diameter
Dobsonian telescope
. The reaction of every student was equally wondrous, even though many had seen the Moon through a telescope several times before.
The Moon is our closest celestial neighbour. It has had a deep impact on our imagination and a profound influence over our lives. Very literally. Life on Earth as we know it would not have been possible without the Moon. The tides, which occur due to the gravitational pull of the Moon, cause the waters of the seas and oceans to retreat and flood coastal lands twice daily. Life, which originated in the oceans, slowly adapted to land as amphibians due to this oscillating aquatic dance
1
. It’s extremely unlikely that you and I would have been around without our Moon. The Moon also protects us by gravitationally deflecting asteroids from impacting the Earth. Many birds and insects use the Moon to migrate and navigate
2
. We clearly owe a lot to the Moon.
“
That’s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.” These were Neil Armstrong’s words upon setting foot on the Moon on 20 July 1969, the day we celebrate each year as International Moon Day.
It would be fair to say that the Moon has captured our imagination more than any other celestial body in the universe. The
first day of the week
is the
​
“
day of the Moon”:
Monday
,
Lundi
,
Montag
,
Somvara
in several languages. The word
​
‘
month’, twelve of which make up our
Gregorian
year, is also derived from
​
‘
moon’, since the period of revolution of the Moon around the Earth is roughly the average length of a month. Civilisations across the world have developed and followed a
lunar calendar
and to this day many of our festivals are celebrated on dates associated with such a calendar. The various phases of the moon evoke varied human emotions, from fear of the darkness during a new Moon night to moonstruck romantic couples dancing on full Moon nights, all of which are immortalised by an array of Bollywood films.
​
“
Chander hanshi” is how Rabindranath Tagore describes the nurturing presence of the Moon smiling down upon us

An astonishing coincidence is that the Sun, which is four hundred times more distant from us than the Moon, has a diameter four hundred times greater than the Moon. This allows the Moon to perfectly obscure the Sun during a total solar eclipse. This is the kind of coincidence that makes even the staunchest atheist amongst us to question our beliefs. Our understanding of the universe has been immeasurably enhanced by eclipses. Einstein’s theory of
General Relativity
was experimentally verified in 1919 which fundamentally altered our view of how the universe works. Many unanswered questions about the outer layers of the solar surface and its corona continue to be investigated during solar eclipses making them one of the most anticipated natural phenomena. It is another remarkable fact that the Moon is receding from us by a few centimeters each year because of the energy lost from friction due to the tides. Total solar eclipses are a feature only of the present time – in a few million years they’ll cease to exist.
“
That’s one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.” These were Neil Armstrong’s words upon setting foot on the Moon on 20 July 1969, the day we celebrate each year as International Moon Day. The first exploration of the Moon started just 10 years prior to this, and almost all missions in between were symbolic achievements inspired by the
Cold War
between the
USA
and the
USSR
. However, during this time several experiments and important tasks were conducted, such as placing retroreflectors on the Moon due to which we know its distance from us to an accuracy of a few millimetres. More recent explorations of the Moon have studied the composition of its soil (which is not very different from the Earth’s); the existence of water (yes, in the form of ice); its seismic activity (‘moonquakes’ do happen, one was detected by the
Chandrayaan
III
lander
, in fact); the range in surface temperature from day to night (a staggering 250°C), and so much more.

Have you ever wondered what role the atmosphere plays in regulating the Earth’s temperature? A perfect way to answer this is to study the Moon which is at the same distance from the Sun as the Earth and does not have an atmosphere. This is precisely what
Arrhenius
and
Langley
did over a 100 years ago in a landmark piece of work
4
. They went further and studied the effect of atmospheric
CO
2
on the Earth’s temperature predicting global warming well before it was on anyone’s mind.
The age has now come when we are likely to impact the Moon as much as it has impacted us. The Moon is set to be used as a staging ground for further exploration of outer space. At one-sixth the mass of the Earth, the gravitational pull exerted by the Moon on any object is likewise lower and this means that it takes less energy to launch rockets from the Moon than from the Earth. A future human colony on the Moon will have its work cut out – lunar residents will have to assemble rockets from parts sent from the Earth, and launch them to the far reaches of the universe. However, there are many other reasons to live and work on the Moon. It is an excellent place for astronomy. Due to the lack of an atmosphere, the sky from the Moon appears dark even during the daytime. This means that an optical telescope can operate at all times, collecting exquisite pictures of stars, galaxies, and nebulae undistorted by any atmosphere.

, in the public domain.
One of my graduate advisors mooted the idea of building a telescope on the ridge of a crater near one of the lunar poles. Such a telescope will almost always be illuminated by the Sun thereby allowing it to harness solar energy for its operation. The icy bottom of the crater, almost always in the dark, will provide enough water for the needs of the moon citizens
5
. Loony, you may say, but a bold idea that has the potential to unlock many new discoveries. Such ground-based lunar telescopes can be much larger than what’s possible to launch into space, thereby enabling the observation of much fainter and distant objects. Radio astronomy on the Moon is another attractive proposition since there are few artificial radio signals on the Moon like there are on the Earth to interfere with cosmic sources
6
.
The Moon was born from the Earth according to the Giant-Impact Hypothesis during the formation of the solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. Though it’s our child it also protects us, nurtures us, teaches us, and allows us to survive. It has a lot of responsibilities to bear and we are foisting much more upon it.
The Moon is tidally locked to the Earth which means that the Moon rotates about its axis at the same rate as it revolves around the Earth. Thus, the length of the lunar day is 29 days, half of which is daytime and the other night. This is why we see only one face of the Moon from the Earth. We can communicate easily with spacecraft that land on this side of the Moon unlike on the
​
“
far side of the Moon”. On full moon nights, our imagination runs riot and we give the Moon unique names: Blue Moon (second full moon of the month), Harvest Moon (full moon nearest the autumnal equinox, when crops are harvested), Wolf Moon (full moon during the bitter winter), Blood Moon (a reddish-purple full moon during a lunar eclipse, when sunlight refracted by the Earth’s atmosphere falls on the Moon), and many more.

. Though it’s our child it also protects us, nurtures us, teaches us, and allows us to survive. It has a lot of responsibilities to bear and we are foisting much more upon it. Nearly every space-faring nation is planning to land spacecraft on the Moon over the next decade. We want to populate the Moon with humans and use it as a base for further colonisation of space. Some feel that The Moon could be our new home should climate change make the Earth uninhabitable. Will the Moon become our world? Or can we remain content gazing upon it through a telescope, exclaiming with wonder,

wow! It’s so beautiful!”?

Shouldering our Fellow Beings’ Presence: Human-Primate Coexistence in India
Based on a recent field visit,
Shaurabh Anand
reflects on the role of
​
‘
agency
’
in shaping human-wildlife interactions in different contexts in India.
The story of wildlife in India is also a story of remarkable human capacities to share and care — to share our common resources and to care for our fellow living beings. Much before the academic articulation of now commonly known terms, such as
​
‘
tolerance’,
​
‘
compassion’, and
​
‘
religious and cultural symbolism’, people engaged in practices that kept wild animals alive in their surroundings.
Human reactions to the presence of an animal in their vicinity have far-reaching consequences for its long-term survival. It is also known that humans’ attitudes towards nature and its elements are not static in time or space.
Last month, when I was roaming around villages in Mysuru to identify a location and a bonnet macaque group to study, I came across several interesting observations related to this dynamic nature of human-animal coexistence.
Our search for bonnet macaques was successful when we located one group of bonnet macaques after a couple of days. A group of bonnet macaques, consisting of males, females, infants, and juveniles, made their appearance in the village where we were resting. Macaques roamed from one house to another, and as the day progressed, they settled near jackfruit trees.
We started chatting with the villagers, starting with our usual questions about the whereabouts of the troop. When we asked if it was feasible to observe the monkeys in this village, we received interesting responses.
“
We often see this group,” said the villagers. And despite some inconvenience, people have been
​
‘
living’ with the monkeys; they are
​
‘
tolerant’ of monkeys.
Agency can be defined as an entity, organisation, or collective that has the potential to change the status quo.
When we asked if we could observe the group, we found that people were fine  with the macaques’ presence. However, our daily observations led some to think that we were responsible for attracting macaques to the village and that we may do something about it (read: catch them and take them away!).
This shows that villagers may change how they live with monkeys once they find someone who can manage the animal-human interactions. When we inquired about the monkeys in various villages, some people asked us if we were there to catch monkeys. It was as if asking about the species put us in charge of their interactions with humans!
The hints to
​
‘
intervene’ in the ongoing activities of both humans and monkeys were strong. The realisation that interventions are not within the scope of our activities was a huge disappointment for them. Their interest in our presence and our conversation dropped sharply, and our questions no longer had any meaning to them.
I observed monkeys engaging in various interactions with humans. In different temple queues, I observed monkeys grabbing food items and literally sitting on people’s shoulders till they acquired a food item.
Shaurabh Anand
Why are these inquiries relevant for human-animal coexistence?
Communities’ reactions to the presence of an animal in their vicinity have far-reaching consequences for its long-term survival (Kansky and Knight 2014; Knight 2000). Several factors drive the coexistence between humans and a common species such as bonnet macaques — communities’ connections and symbolisms, and societal value interactions (Knight 1999).  It is also known that humans’ attitudes towards nature and its elements are not static in time or space (Sago and Gatson 2020).  Therefore, it is important to keep scanning the horizons to look for signs of any such changes and what is driving those shifts. This is highly relevant for species that live in close physical proximity to humans.
My observations suggest that in addition to these well-known factors, invisibility of an agency contributes to the continuation of a state of coexistence. Here, agency can be defined as an entity, organisation, or collective that has the potential to change the status quo.
This further brings up several questions for which I do not have a clear answer yet — were we the first ones to ask them about monkeys? Did our non-local identities create an expectation of certain actions? Were we being seen as part of state machinery? What notional responsibilities must one be aware of while doing animal observations in the
​
‘
field’? Or does venting out about these inconveniences act as a safety valve and prevent more drastic interventions?
I do not know for sure, as answering these questions needs in-depth, long-term, multi-species ethnographic and historical research. However, in this context, when villagers got to know that we were here to
​
‘
study’ monkeys and that we would not be catching them, they genuinely asked if our
​
‘
study’ and our
​
‘
observation’ would make them stay away from the village.

People’s search for agencies and demand for action have already started in places like villages and farmlands. It is only to be seen for how long before the same demands start arising from other places.
What happens when people fail to find such agencies? Evidence indicates that, at some point, they will assume this role themselves. Transforming from participants in human-primate interactions, they acquire the role of manager, eradicator, or problem solver and often engage in activities that may not seem desirable in normal circumstances.
This transformation is different from guarding and protecting valuables from monkey damage. Numerous reports of people capturing and translocating monkeys, or even lethally poisoning them, point to this phenomenon.
On the last leg of our field visit, we made a quick stop at the Chamundi Hill temple. This is one of the few remaining safe abodes for bonnet macaques. This is also a place to observe people’s tolerance towards monkeys.
I observed monkeys engaging in various interactions with humans. In different temple queues, I observed monkeys grabbing food items and sitting on people’s shoulders till they acquired a food item.
This reiterates the initial point with which this article started. It indeed proves that the survival of several wildlife species in India is
​
‘
shouldered’ by our tolerance for their presence. However, people’s search for agencies and demand for action have already started in places like villages and farmlands. It is only to be seen for how long before the same demands start arising from other places.
NOTE
: I would like to express my sincere thanks to Dr. Vani Kulkarni and Suraj N for all the help with the fieldwork. I would also like to express my sincere thanks to Vignesh S for engaging in discussions on these topics.

The Backgrounds of Our Lives: Education during
COVID-19
Sindhu Mathai
on background sounds in online classes during the
COVID-19
pandemic.
The pandemic has driven us home
Driving home online classes
There is a distance I experience
Unspoken spaces and silences.
How do I know you through video streaming?
Or through the masks we put on?
In being watched and recorded?
Our lives not playing along.
Desperately I searched
To move into the background
To make each of you speak
To address you from beyond.
I turned to make you present
Hoping to notice more
About your selves and lives,
Our invisible trauma, therefore.
There were vivid sounds I heard:
A narrative being formed
A peek into your private living
And the public that surrounds.
It ought to be in the background
But the background’s now nearer!
Each from a different home
From a life like no other.
There’s someone having a bath
The rhythm of sloshing sounds!
Embarrassment? No, No!
This is just as profound.
Movement of heavy objects
With rough, loud words – unowned
No need for apology in living
On the edge of containment zones.
There’s a dog running and barking,
It refuses to be stopped!
There’s someone running over
To bring it to a halt.
Sweet birdsong in the morning
From the tree just above
Alerts to the angst of the missing
​
‘
signal’
And the missing
​
‘
natural’ longed for.
Here’s a child wailing now finally
Who’s usually considerate and playing
Here’s amma presenting, leaving him behind!
She’s often quieter – what’s wrong?
The sounds of strong winds blowing
The outdoors is where I should be
If I could escape chaotic routine
And work with certainty.
The backgrounds of our lives,
No more beyond and further
Each from a different home
From a life like no other.

Documentation of Traditional Ecological Knowledge by Adivasi Children
Aswathy Arun
,
Harini Nagendra
and
Seema Mundoli
shed light on the activity-based learning (
ABL
) worksheets created for Adivasi children of Bastar, to enhance their understanding of the surroundings and nurture pride in their rich cultural heritage.
A glimpse of one of the activities under
​
‘
Mapping our Village’, to help children understand and appreciate their surroundings — including natural and man-made resources, cultural sites and important facilities in their village.
Adivasi constitute 8.6 percent of India’s population, and Bastar district in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh is home to several Adivasi communities. The economic, social, and cultural life of Adivasis here is closely connected to the forest landscape in which they live. The Adivasi communities, especially the older generation, are repositories of valuable traditional ecological knowledge transferred across generations.
Mainstream education is critical for building the capabilities of Adivasis to live in today’s world. But equally imperative is finding ways to ensure the continued connection of the younger generation with their traditional practices and bolstering a sense of pride in their ecological knowledge.
Keeping this in mind, and on the request of the Chhattisgarh Forest Department, we designed activity-based learning (
ABL
) worksheets for Adivasi children of Bastar.
These worksheets were aimed at enabling Adivasi children to document different aspects of biodiversity around them, explore their community’s traditional practices and highlight nature-culture relationships. The worksheets were contextually designed and included a mix of in-class activities, field data collection, and performances.
Activities like village mapping, where students collectively identify natural and man-made resources, cultural sites, infrastructure/​facilities, etc. were designed to not only enhance their understanding of the surroundings but also nurture pride in their rich cultural heritage.
Mainstream education is critical for building the capabilities of Adivasis to live in today’s world. But equally imperative is finding ways to ensure the continued connection of the younger generation with their traditional practices and bolstering a sense of pride in their ecological knowledge.
Through the sheets, students were introduced to bird watching sessions to provide hands-on experiences with local biodiversity, complemented by collecting oral stories about local birds from elders, connecting generations.
A worksheet focusing on medicinal plants was aimed at encouraging students to appreciate the traditional ecological knowledge of their community, the medicinal properties of local plants and the traditional methods of preparing medicines using the plants.
The worksheets also included an exploration of the traditional festivals, agricultural and non-timber forest product diversity, and cultural relevance of trees — all of which were aimed at highlighting the nature-culture relationships that rarely find focus in the mainstream education curriculum the Adivasi children were exposed to.
“
We see the worksheets as a repository documented by the children of their local knowledge and practices. These worksheets are versatile and can be adapted easily to other rural and forested regions of India, and even adapted to peri-urban settings.”
Aswathy
The hands-on activities include making a model of the village and the landscape around, making seed bombs that help with forest regeneration and creating a tree using leaves the children collect and bring to class.
The in-class and hands-on activities go beyond conventional textbook learning. These worksheets also had the web of life activity emphasising the interconnectedness of humans, animals and plants of the ecosystem. The
ABL
worksheets not only facilitate a more effective approach to nature-based education but also contribute to the preservation of traditional knowledge.
We see the worksheets as a repository documented by the children of their local knowledge and practices. These worksheets are versatile and can be adapted easily to other rural and forested regions of India, and even adapted to peri-urban settings.
These are currently available in
Hindi
and
English
.
Moreover, we have also designed colouring worksheets featuring native birds, reptiles, and animals found in this landscape. These
colouring worksheets
can be freely downloaded
here
and used for educational purposes.
We believe that worksheets like these align with our University’s vision to provide education for social change by promoting environmental care and cultural pride.

Chronicles of Child Labour: Building New Narratives
Anuradha Nagaraj
recounts her conversation with a survivor of child trafficking, who had the rare agency and ability to revisit her past in a matter-of-fact way
When I first met Badaik in 2017, she was around 17 years old. I was on a reporting trip in Assam, following a lead on child trafficking from the tea gardens. Day one had yielded very little information and day two did not look too promising either when I was introduced to Badaik. I was informed that she had been sold to work in a home when she was just knee-high and had recently found her way back, an unusual occurrence in a region where girls simply went missing.
Badaik did not want to talk to me initially. She just nodded in response to all the chatter around her, listening intently as village elders and activists explained the modus operandi of child traffickers in the area. But in a moment of silence, as everyone sipped tea, she took me aside and said she had decided to tell me her story. She did not explain her decision, but said she wanted her voice to be heard, and hoped her younger sister, who had also been trafficked for work, would be found. She began hesitantly, but over the next hour or so recounted every minute detail of her years working as a domestic help in a home where children her age went to school.
It was a rare occasion to hear a first-hand account of what happens when a child arrives in an unfamiliar home and becomes a maid. Badaik had a vivid memory of being trained as a house help – from being asked to peel garlic and sweeping the house in the early days to doing the dishes and laundry by the time she was eight years old.
“
What happens when a child arrives in an unfamiliar home and becomes a maid? My distinct memory of that conversation with Badaik is of great discomfort, of wanting to get up and leave. Badaik’s matter-of-fact voice, the enormity of what she was describing and the soft sobs of her mother sitting nearby travelled back with me and stayed with me.”
Anuradha Nagaraj
My distinct memory of that conversation is of great discomfort, of wanting to get up and leave. Badaik’s matter-of-fact voice, the enormity of what she was describing and the soft sobs of her mother sitting nearby travelled back with me and stayed with me as I wrote the
article
.
What I wrote barely did justice to what I had heard, given the constraints of word limit and structure. Badaik’s voice did travel with that article, but it always bothered me that it did not capture everything that I had heard and felt that afternoon in the courtyard of her home. A lot of that conversation remained in my notebook.
Then, in 2020, Jamlo died. She was 12 and walking home during the
COVID-19
lockdown. She had migrated to chilli fields for seasonal work with others from her village. Unlike Badaik, Jamlo could not tell her story and instead, there were government officials, relatives and activists who spoke on her behalf about the laws to prevent child labour, the push factors for such migration and the difficult time the family was going through.
In 2021, author Samina Mishra wrote
Jamlo Walks
, a children’s book that told the same story from the viewpoint of the young girl. What the book captured, none of the news reports could. The author was able to imagine what Jamlo’s last few hours could have been like. It was a devastating narrative.
Construed and constructed
The narrative around child labour is largely constructed by adults.
In my early days of interviewing children who had been rescued from work sites, the interaction was always limited. The first thing as we would settle down for the conversation, which the child would often be told was an interview, would be an effort by the accompanying adult to almost make it seem like just another day. The child would be told that it was a
​
“
safe space” where they could
​
“
speak without fear”. What would follow would be a discussion largely prompted by adults, hesitant responses from the child, with the adult feeling compelled to fill in the silences.
These bits and pieces of conversation helped build the narrative, but it was never complete.
In shelter homes, groups of children often find solace in a collective narrative, one that unifies them in their experience of back-breaking work in dimly-lit rooms making bangles or toiling in non-descript sweet shops. In these instances, the response to questions is more generic, often given after a quiet nod from the group. Not everyone speaks but whoever chooses to, speaks on behalf of everyone.
Then there were instances when the only available evidence of child labour being practiced were official documents – an official complaint, a police report, anti-child labour campaigner statements or anecdotal accounts of raids and rescue. In all instances, the voice of the child was summarised, often with terminology that was academic or legal in nature.
Accordingly, the stories around child labour in the media are largely uni-dimensional, capturing one aspect of a complex issue – the illegality of the act. These stories amp up the element of pathos (appealing to emotions) using selective quotes, images and videos.
“
Can voice notes, videos and podcasts become tools of expression for children who have toiled despite bans and outrage?”
Owning the narrative
The conversation with Badaik was different because it went beyond what the media usually wrote about. She was also hesitant but had more agency and the ability to revisit her past in a matter-of-fact way. Maybe it was her age or her concern for her younger sister whom she lost to one of the homes where she was employed. Either way, the conversation triggered the larger debate on trauma-informed interviewing techniques, the need for more granular testimonials and the possibility of enabling child labour survivors to decide how and when they would want their narratives told. And most importantly, to whom, given that trust is a key issue for survivors.
Recently, young girls working in brick kilns in Uttar Pradesh were taught to use mobile phones to record their life at work. Encouraged to think of what aspect of their lives they would like to highlight, the girls came up with unexpected responses. While the punishing workplace, bonded labour, child labour and lack of wages are issues that dominate the discourse around workers, one of the girls chose to make a short film on her challenge to access clean sanitary products during her periods at the kiln. Like Badaik, she chose to tell the story she wanted, and it was not about the work she was doing or why she was doing it.
In New Delhi, a newspaper run by street children called
Balaknama
has created that opportunity, doing away with the gatekeeping role of adults when it comes to stories about children and the issues that impact them.
In Gorakhpur,
radio channel Loudspeaker
was started by a non-profit to give children rescued from work an opportunity to express themselves and educate the town on child labour laws.
Could this be the way forward? Can voice notes, videos and podcasts become tools of expression for children who have toiled despite bans and outrage? As a chronicler of many of these cases, I believe they can. And in the process, it might just capture something that is not so obvious – a dream, a thought or just an anecdote that nobody asked about.

Redoing Gender and Self
Vishnu Prakash K
reflects on his journey towards understanding education and change.
As a fortunate child,
1
I had the privilege of enjoying a wealth of childhood memories from my schooling experience. I attended government-aided schools till the tenth grade. My memories of school include more than just the life within the school. They include the everyday journey of walking to school and returning home while relishing the beauty of trees, rivers, and the blue sky of a coastal village in Kerala.
These memories are also about the public life within the school and village. The school I attended provided me with opportunities to meet many poets, film and theatre artists, activists, and scientists. Almost every weekend during my school days, my friends and I were at the school attending camps, festivals, meetings, and child club activities.
I was not living this journey alone; my twin sister accompanied me until the seventh standard, along with many other friends from the village. We exchanged ideas and thoughts through our involvement in clubs and public engagements. My sister was particularly active in sports, with her potential in sports and other co-curricular activities matching mine.
Unfortunately, the gender binaries prevalent in our society cast a shadow over our childhood. Something unanticipated happened during our high school years: my parents restricted my sister’s involvement in activities outside of the family and school. This restriction coincided with the final years of middle school and the onset of her menstrual cycle.
Kumar (2021) made similar observations of drastic changes in adolescent life as a boy in his autobiographical essay
Growing Up Male
. Unlike Kumar, my experience as a girl/​boy was not so divided due to the presence of women activists in my school and village. However, the understanding of gender binaries in family and society, and the separation of my sister from my life in school and society, confused my thoughts. We began to lead significantly different lives.
When I was admitted to a postgraduate programme followed by doctoral research at Tata Institute of Social Sciences (
TISS
), my sister got married at the age of 21. My resistance and rebellion to stop her marriage were simply silenced by my family and relatives. However, my sister continued her life within the family circle. She is restricted by familial duties and no longer dreams about her passions. On the other side, I am continuing my journey of inquiry through education!
I briefly recollected my childhood and young adulthood memories here to demonstrate the profound influence of family, community, and school on self. The education process is pervasive in human life, the separation of education from family and community and confining it within the institutional constraints of school and college is bringing down its transformative potential. This understanding of education and schooling always guided my inquiry into the transformative potential of school as a pedagogic institution.
As a teacher, whenever I walk into my classroom I ask the questions: Can I see myself in my students? Can I understand their journeys as the journeys of struggle and aspirations, as the journeys of pain and joy? Can I redo myself in this process of education as a teacher?
Vishnu Prakash Kareepadath
My childhood experiences with gender in society and my encounters with the idea of social change enabled me to inquire about gender, school, and social change. Gender as a social structure haunted me more than other structural issues in our society. My learnings on structural issues were always perceived through the lens of gender. This continued in my research journey.
I used the concept of
​
“
Doing gender” (West and Zimmerman, 1987) to understand the pedagogic process of the school.
Doing gender
elaborates feminine-masculine manifestations of gender through
interactional
and
institutional
mediations in life. The individual is doing gender in a web of interactions. The sociological web of life
offered
to children in the family, school, and society is
dynamic
.
The world around the child is
offered
in such a way that it constrains the
agency
of the young member of society to evolve whereas the
dynamic
character of the world opens the windows of possibilities for her. This dialectical notion of power offers possibilities to understand gender through the dominance of society and the autonomy of the individual in society.
While accounting for their article on
Doing gender
West and Zimmerman used the concept of
Redoing gender
in 2009. Redoing gender is all about redoing self and society. It is a journey of continuous negotiations with self and society using the given opportunities. Redoing gender (not undoing) helped me locate my investigation into the pedagogical potential of schools in offering an emancipatory learning experience. I experienced my higher education journey as a continuous evolution of the self through my negotiations with my identity as a boy and as a male member of society.
On each day of the school visit, during my research, interactions with children and teachers unfolded as negotiations with the self. The analysis of the curriculum, and meaning-making of the children in school, family, and local community offered a rich reflective experience of understanding the researcher-researched dichotomy and joy of transcending the boundaries of the self and others in our society.
I am not claiming that my educational experience or research experience was an ideal journey of learning. I was bound by the norms and rules of institutions and society. Gender binaries and the age hierarchy also constrained me. My class and caste background created challenges throughout this journey. The world was presented to me in a way that constrained my
agency
, yet it also presented windows of possibilities because of its
dynamic
character. Hence, my journey continues, and the change continues.
Individuals perceive the extent of dehumanisation, they may ask if humanisation is a viable possibility. Within history, in concrete, objective contexts, both humanisation and dehumanisation are possibilities for a person as an uncompleted being conscious of their incompletion.
– Paulo Freire (Pedagogy of the Oppressed)
While I am writing this note, I am thinking about my new journey as a teacher at Azim Premji University. Azim Premji University works to fulfil the vision of
Education for Social Change
and aims to achieve a just, equitable and humane world within and outside the University. This is reflected in our campus culture. We are trying our best to develop a gender-just educational milieu in our campus. As a teacher, whenever I walk into my classroom I ask the questions:
Can I see myself in my students? Can I understand their journeys as the journeys of struggle and aspirations, as the journeys of pain and joy? Can I redo myself in this process of education as a teacher?
I will end this note by quoting one of my favourite educators, Paulo Freire, from
Pedagogy of the Oppressed
–
​
“
Individuals perceive the extent of dehumanisation, they may ask if humanisation is a viable possibility. Within history, in concrete, objective contexts, both humanisation and dehumanisation are possibilities for a person as an uncompleted being conscious of their incompletion.”
Note:
In contemporary society, childhood happiness is a privilege. Many children are experiencing violence and trauma in their everyday life.

The First of May | Louis Paul Boon
On
International Workers’ Day
,
A Giridhar Rao
shares a translation of
​
‘
The First of May’, prose poetry by
Louis Paul Boon
.
Now I must write with my best pen, my summer pen, my Sunday pen. Adorn it with a red ribbon, and dip it in ink with which are written only words of joy, of sunshine and happiness, of freedom and cheerfulness;
Unfortunately, it is a pen I am not used to. I write with it the way I will later march in the procession: a little strangely, a little lost in the celebrations. Forgive me.
Great joy and great happiness always make me a bit quiet. I pinch my arm to know that I am not dreaming. I see so many flags during the march and I know that there’s my own flag: the flag that I always carry by myself in my heart, day after day.
I feel again then, the First of May, that I’m not alone, that I have not fought all alone for a little happiness in life, for some justice between us, for a better house, and a kind wife who is not exhausted by too much work.
This touches me deeply. Not everything is in vain, I silently think, deep in my heart. Hundreds, thousands, millions throughout the world think like me, carry the same flag in their hearts. And the First of May, the most beautiful day of the year, they come out with that flag, and march in processions, everywhere, in Paris and in Moscow and in London, and in my own little village of Waaiendijk.
There are people everywhere who think like me, who, like me, reap the fruits of what our parents achieved: the 8‑hour day, the 5‑day week, the paid holidays. And those are only the visible things, a few concrete things.
Because the rest is much more. The freedom to write what I think, the right to be who I am, the ability to look at the king, emperor or pope with my hands in my pockets. Not having to take off my cap if I don’t want to, not having to kneel and beg for bread crumbs, or a small place in heaven.
We no longer have to beg, we have acquired everything ourselves.
For that, thousands upon thousands march beside one another, under the red flag of the First of May. I should actually rejoice, I know, but I am too emotional and remain silent: for respect towards myself.
Tomorrow, the day after, my little flag will again lie folded, deep in my heart’s pocket, but today it is unfurled and flutters red, red, red, throughout the world.
Note on the text
This is an English translation of an Esperanto translation of the Belgian Dutch original. As an easy-to-learn language with a flexible word order, Esperanto has often functioned as an effective
​
“
relay language”.
I first read Jakvo Schram’s Esperanto translation of this prose poem in 2008 on his
blog
and translated it into English for my
blog
. Schram had first published his translation in
Sennaciulo
(May 2004,
PDF
), the magazine of the left-wing Esperanto organisation
Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda
(World
​
‘
Anational’ Association. More here:
SAT
).
Neither his blog nor the magazine mentioned the source of the prose poem. Finally, in 2024, an Esperantist friend in The Netherlands tracked it down: Louis Paul Boon,
​
“
De eerste mei”,
Vooruit
, May 1962. The poem also appears in Boon’s collection,
Boontjes 1962
(1992).

My Rabindranath: A reminiscence
Ashok Sircar’s personal journey with Tagore
আমার রবীন্দ্রনাথ
অশোক সরকারের জীবনের চলার পথে রবীন্দ্রনাথকে পাওয়ার কাহিনী
এটি বাংলায় পড়ুন
Memories come rushing in, when I try to write something from memory. Each one says,
​
‘
Write about me, write about me!’ Time passes by, choosing which one to write about and which one to keep only for myself. Still, given the request, I have to write something.
Growing up in Santiniketan for the first 22 years of my life and staying in close contact for another 40 years is not a short time. My first regular step outside home was to go to
Ananda Pathshala
(roughly, School of Joy). You might call it a nursery school, but for us it was the
Pathshala
of
Anandam
. That’s where I started to get to know Rabindranath, although this institution was born 16 – 17 years after his death. I can’t say I got to know him at the age of four. Much later, I realised that the relationship between
Anandam
and
Pathshala
is inherently Tagorean (
Rabindrik
). At that age, though, I understood that trees, flowers, animals, birds, and insects were growing companions of our lives. So, I, like many others, started liking the shades of the trees to sleep under, their branches to climb, the chirping of birds to copy, the colours and fragrance of flowers to feel, and the little world of the insects to enjoy. On the contrary, sitting on the veranda of the Dehali building, and trying to learn the alphabet, my mind would get restless, thinking that the squirrel must have run away, or the plants must be thirsty. Keeping calm if a butterfly flew by was certainly difficult!
I must have learnt something about alphabets and reading at Ananda Pathshala, but my sincere interest in nature was born there. Seeing nature as one’s own is probably Tagore’s first contribution to my upbringing. After two years, I got admission to class
II
in Patha Bhavan. I had a few books and a small mattress to sit on the ground. My father bought them from the Visva-Bharati Cooperative. This cooperative was established in 1915. It is probably the only university in India that has its own marketing cooperative. Visva-Bharati also has its cooperative bank. Established in 1927, it is still alive and kicking. Rabindranath himself was the initiator of these cooperatives. The university had not been born yet. There was a school and an ashram. The idea of ​​cooperatives arose so that the residents could get essential household items at a fair price. Around the same time, the work of forming cooperatives also started in the villages around Santiniketan. When I was admitted to school in 1962, the cooperative was starting again, which, after Rabindranath’s death, had been closed for some time due to financial reasons. Needless to say, I did not know the value of cooperatives then. Later, when I came to know about it, I read about Rabindranath’s ideas and work on cooperatives. I read the pioneering book written by him,
The Co-operative Principles
(1928).
This school was 61 years old at that time. Classes were still held under tree’s shade. Girls and boys used to sit in an arc. In the middle of the circle sat the teacher, whom we used to call
Dada
or
Didi
.  The words
​
“
Sir” or
​
“
Ma’am” were alien to us. There was no first bench, no last bench, good students in front, bad students in the back – none of these. The school had no school uniform. The usual practice was to sit on our knees on the mattress, keeping our notebooks on the ground, moving from one tree’s shade to another. From
Niranjan-da’s bedi to Nandita-di’s bedi
. As I grew up, I could understand that this way of addressing the teachers or the class arrangement was part of an attempt to create an educational culture different from the etiquette of modern schools created by the British. Our Vice-Chancellor of the university at that time was Sudhiranjan Das. We called him
​
“
Sudhi Dadu”. The famous philosopher Kalidas Bhattacharya became the Vice-Chancellor in 1966. We called him
​
“
Kalidasada”.
Under the shade of many huge trees, there were spaces for classes made with
morum
and brick borders, a slightly high altar in the middle, and a blackboard on a wooden stand next to it. I had classes under these trees throughout my school life. During rains, classes were held on the verandas of some houses. Our punishment was having to go into a room – was to go to the science laboratory in later years or to study in the library.  Music class was mandatory up until we finished school in class
XI
. Sitting under a tree, we would sing Tagore songs in unison in Shitangshu-da’s music class. We must have sung a few dozen songs during the ten years of music classes. It was a Bengali-medium school, so there was a special emphasis on Bangla literature. We had to read many of Tagore’s writings — both prose and poetry. I read his
Jibansmriti
(1911,
My Reminiscences
1917) while I was in school.
I experienced Rabindranath in many ways during my school life. From morning prayers, evening literary meetings, forming groups to stage Rabindranath’s plays
Mukut
(1908),
Dakghar
(1912,
The Post Office
1914), and others. There was a lot more. Rabindra Sangeet was a part of our lives. I remember a song taught by the music teacher Shitanshu-da —
Kanta Bono Biharini
– which none of us believed to be a song written by Rabindranath. The song was a satire about a group of singers who could not sing. When I got home, I opened the
Geet Bitaan
(Collection of Tagore’s songs) and found out if the song was really in it!
The class on nature studies was a special attraction. Our teacher Barin-Da, used to say that there is a lot to learn from nature, and
​
“
remember that we exist because nature exists”. He would form us into groups and take us on trips in different directions. We learned the names of plants, learned to understand insects and spiders, and learned to observe the movements of various animals and birds. We were very fond of an insect called the velvet insect. We would take it in our palms and release it again. Barin-da would get very angry if we imprisoned any insect in a box – he would say that they too have a free life like us.
Rabindranath thought that a person’s life is of two kinds – one is life lived for a living, which she needs to eat, study, and work; another is to live life in full, for which she sings, paints, dances, acts, and fills her life with joy. Both are needed to fulfil life.
Santiniketan had many festivals during our time. Rabindranath’s birthday was celebrated on the first day of
Baisakh
. This tradition has been going on since the time of Rabindranath. The summer was intensely hot, and wells ran dry, leading to a water shortage, so the summer vacation would begin on 1
st
May, and therefore his birthday used to be celebrated on 14
th
or 15
th
April, the first day of
Baisakh
. Apart from that, there were
Basant Utsav, Barsha Mangal, Sharadotsav, Brikshoropon, Maghotsav, Paush Mela
, etc.
These were all part of the ashram life. Rabindranath thought that a person’s life is of two kinds – one is life lived for a living, which she needs to eat, study, and work; another is to live life in full, for which she sings, paints, dances, acts, and fills her life with joy. Both are needed to fulfil life. So, just as there was education in our lives, ours was a childhood full of joy and celebration, and adolescence. A joyful life filled with songs, dramas, acting, writing, recitations, and literary meetings.
If Santiniketan was a pursuit of culture, then Sriniketan could be called a pursuit of the future of the country.
Along with joy, there was also responsibility. We were involved in organising events at various festivals. Organising literary meetings was our job. We would arrange the venue, convince the president, and decide who would read, recite, and sing. We would try to ensure that there was no shortage of audience. The students’ magazine
Amader Lekha
(
Our Writings
) was published every year. I was involved in organising that magazine while in the senior class.
When I was in the eighth grade, my father was transferred to Sriniketan. Sriniketan was established in 1922, about four kilometres west of Santiniketan. It was very different. If Santiniketan was a pursuit of culture, then Sriniketan could be called a pursuit of the future of the country. This is where the Dairy, Agricultural College, Rural Reconstruction Department,
Palli Charcha Kendra
(Vocational training Centre),
Shilpa Sadan
(Handicrafts and handlooms training and marketing outlet) and Rabindranath’s second school,
Siksha Satra,
were established. We stayed in Sriniketan for four years. That’s when I met a different Rabindranath.
The university was working on rural development in 39 villages, with which my father was associated.
Siksha Satra
was established as a village school, where the curriculum was organised around the needs of village life. A separate vocational training centre was established to train youth, including girls, in meaningful vocations.
Shilpa Sadan
was a handloom and crafts centre with a marketing outlet. The agricultural college was located next to where we lived. Farmers’ training was part of the rural reconstruction work in Tagore’s time, from which a full-fledged agricultural college was born.
Much of this started in 1922 on the initiative of Rabindranath himself. Sriniketan had its own festivals, the
Halakarshan
and the
Sriniketan Mela.
The
Halakarshan
was the beginning of the monsoon cultivation held in August, and the
Sriniketan Mela
was held in February, when the crops were harvested. I can’t say I understood Tagore’s Sriniketan experiment fully while in school. But I did understand something. The Naxalbari Movement was rising in West Bengal, and by 1970, it had reached Santiniketan and Sriniketan. The Naxalites attacked everyone from Rabindranath to
Ram Mohan Roy
and
Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar
. Its impact also affected us. At that time, speakers at several events spoke about the transformative thoughts in Rabindranath’s rural philosophy. Even though I did not understand everything, I could vaguely feel the conflict between the two ideologies. Much later, it became clear to me that Sriniketan was built to pursue the dream of making the village stand on its own feet, along with urban civilisation. Those who are aware know that after 1924, Rabindranath also paid special attention to Sriniketan. He thought that if we were to build a future India, its foundation had to be built in the villages.
We returned to Santiniketan in 1971. I spent the next six years finishing school and college. At that time, I had the opportunity to understand Rabindranath a little better. I had been watching the play
Chandalika Chitrangada
(1892,
Chitra
1914) since I was a child, but the deep social message against the caste system and patriarchy became clear only then. The performance of the play
Raktakarabi
(1924,
Red Oleanders
) moved me greatly. That was the first time I got to see the nature of dictatorship. Around the same time, I had the opportunity to read two novels of Rabindranath,
Gora
(1910)
and Ghore Baire
(1916,
The Home and the World
), and some short stories. Both novels were written around the Swadeshi idea. At the same time, I first heard about the ideological conflict between Gandhi and Rabindranath. Much later,
The Mahatma and the Poet
(1997), the book written by Sabyasachi Da (Sabyasachi Bhattacharya), sheds extensive light on this subject.
In 1977, I left Santiniketan for higher education, but I did not lose contact with Rabindranath. Tagore’s songs would spring first if I had to sing. Rabindranath returned again and again in my teaching, while talking about cooperatives, rural development, or the ideas of an alternative educational programme. Rabindranath’s warning against nationalism, written in 1916, still acts as my guide. And of course, the awareness to save the environment owes its birth to Rabindranath. The secular festivals of
Basant Utsav, Barsha Mangal, Sharadotsav,
etc., speak loudly against the current distorted form of religious culture. Needless to say, amidst the overall crisis in education, I only feel how lucky we were to have the opportunity to live and study in Santiniketan-Sriniketan.

On getting back our sense of kinship and intimacy with the environment
On
Earth Day
(April 22),
Saswati Paik
highlights the need to strike a balance between development and moving towards a sustainable environment.
“
One of the first conditions of happiness is that the link between man and nature shall not be broken.”
Leo Tolstoy

On January 28, 1969, a shocking environmental disaster unfolded. An oil pipeline burst off the coast of California, releasing over 3 million gallons of oil into the ocean near Santa Barbara. The devastating
Santa Barbara oil spill
resulted in the deaths of thousands of birds, fish, and intertidal invertebrates. Additionally, many dolphins, elephant seals, and sea lions were affected.
President Nixon visited Santa Barbara on March 21, 1969, witnessing the spill and the ongoing cleanup efforts. Around the same time, Senator Gaylord Nelson from Wisconsin, known as the
​
“
Conservation Governor,” observed the 800 square-mile oil slick from an airplane. This experience inspired him to propose a national day dedicated to environmental education: Earth Day in 1970.
On April 22, 1970, more than 20 million Americans participated in Earth Day events, emphasizing the importance of environmental awareness and action. In 2008, Indian poet and diplomat Abhay Kumar penned the
​
“
Earth Anthem
.” Rooted in the Indian philosophy of
​
“
Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” (meaning
​
“
The World is One Family”), this anthem celebrates our interconnectedness and shared responsibility for our planet.
Meanwhile, last year, during Deepawali, a concern was highlighted in the media regarding air pollution across India, especially in metro cities like New Delhi.
Around that time, during an interaction, some people in Bengaluru said that air pollution is a concern for New Delhi, not Bengaluru, and did not bother about the consequences of bursting crackers in Bengaluru. But does air recognize political boundaries? And why do we sometimes ignore environmental pollution?
A few days back, at a beach in Puri, Odisha, I noticed a mother encouraging her kid to throw plastic bottles into the water. The kid seemingly enjoyed the sight of the bottles floating along the waves. After a while, both the mother and kid left the beach, leaving behind those plastic bottles. I collected those and threw them into the nearby dustbin.
This experience prompted more questions: How are we educated about our environment? Do we truly prioritize learning about environmental issues through school curricula, especially in subjects like Environmental Studies or Geography?
The culture of kinship with other creatures on Earth has perhaps become subdued through societal transformation, industrial development, and rapid urbanisation. The sense of kinship and intimacy with our environment has been largely blurred due to the material developments around us.
However, there are glimmers of hope. During a field visit in Karnataka, I encountered an enthusiastic Head Teacher in a government school. This teacher allocated plants to students of different grades. Each student was responsible for maintaining and nurturing their assigned plant. Through this process, students gained an understanding of the stages and factors associated with a plant’s growth. This initiative could easily evolve into a broader environmental education activity, engaging local communities in caring for our shared environment.

The children of today are our future citizens. Their learning and practices will impact the future of this planet. When children start formal education in school, from their primary classes they are introduced to planet Earth and human interactions with the immediate environment on this planet. They learn about scientific innovations and modern technology, the occurrence of large-scale exploitation because of increased demand for resources which further influences the environmental ecological structure.
They also learn about the deterioration of the environment and the
fever
of planet Earth. Some of the symptoms of planetary fever include shrinking glaciers, shifting plant and animal ranges, sea level rise, more intense heat waves, and stronger hurricanes.
All such issues are associated with human interaction with the environment leading to unplanned development and over-exploitation of all resources. At this point, various confusions emerge. What is the right aspect to choose — development or sustainable environment? How do we balance these two aspects and change the situation towards a better future? These are questions that occupy us at Azim Premji University too! See some of our initiatives listed at the end of this post.
We need to get our kinship with the environment back, which may help us make a better environment on a better planet with better education. Happy Earth Day!

From Mother Tongue to Other Tongues: English-medium Schooling in Karnataka
On International Mother Language Day,
A Giridhar Rao
emphasises Kannada learning. This will also make children learn English better.
International Mother Language Day (
IMLD
) is celebrated on Feb. 21. As the
UNESCO
website
reminds us,
​
“
Today, 40% of the world’s population does not have access to education in a language they speak or understand. In some countries, this figure rises to over 90%.” It is in this context that this post looks at
a news report
on the recent Karnataka decision to expand
​
“
bilingual sections” in government schools.
In these bilingual sections, teaching happens in both English and Kannada, or English and Urdu. (In the other sections of these schools, the Language of Instruction (LoI) remains Kannada or Urdu.) Apart from these bilingual sections, Karnataka also has a thousand or so Karnataka Public Schools where the LoI is English. The report informs us that, in all, there are 2,686 such
​
“
bilingual schools” – a mere 5.7% of a total of 46,757 government schools (primary and secondary) across Karnataka. The news report says some 600 more proposals for bilingual sections are being evaluated.

A major concern is the shortage of teachers
​
“
who can effectively teach [in] the English medium”. In these bilingual sections (in these 2,686 schools), there is a 35% shortage of teachers. And, overall, in the state, there is a 23% shortage of teachers; 53,860 more teachers are needed!
So the urgent task seems to be appointing qualified teachers in the state – not just teachers who can teach in English, but many more teachers in Kannada. Teacher shortage has serious consequences. For example, the Annual Status of Education Report (
ASER
;
PDF
) paints this dismal picture of the reading abilities of Karnataka’s schoolchildren. Take a look at column two in this table (p. 142):
This is the situation of students in Grade V (in government schools) who can read a Grade
II
text. In 2012, it was 47.2%. That is, less than half could do the task. By 2018, it had barely increased – to 47.6%. Then the pandemic struck, and in 2022, only 29.2% of students in Grade V could read a Grade
II
text!
Between the same years, the situation of students in Grade
III
is even more dire (p. 142).
From 21.2% in 2012, it dropped to 19.4% in 2018. Then, post the
COVID-19
pandemic in 2022, the learning loss was so severe that only 7.7% of Grade
III
students could read a Grade
II
text. This learning loss has been meticulously documented by Azim Premji University’s
​
“
Loss of Learning during the Pandemic” (2021;
PDF
) which finds that:
92% of children on an average have lost at least one specific language ability from the previous year across all classes. Illustratively, these specific abilities include describing a picture or their experiences orally; reading familiar words; reading with comprehension; and writing simple sentences based on a picture. (p. 28)
In the
ASER
survey, remember that the survey is testing reading in Kannada. Imagine what the results are likely to be for reading in English!
The most effective path seems to be: Other Tongues through the Mother Tongue!
UNESCO
’s theme for
IMLD
2024 is
​
“
Multilingual education: A pillar of intergenerational learning”. As the Concept Note (
PDF
) says multilingual education:
enhances learning when the language of instruction is the learner’s first language… Learning in one’s first language facilitates understanding and interaction, and further develops critical thinking. It strengthens self-confidence and self-esteem and stimulates active participation. In addition to boosting learning, multilingual education contributes to opening the doors to intergenerational learning, the preservation of culture and intangible heritage, and the revitalization of languages.
Crucially, the note also add
s
:
​
“
The use of learners’ own languages for literacy and learning provides a solid pillar for education, and for transfer of skills and knowledge to additional languages.”
Decades of research has shown this, of course. A recent overview is the 2021 World Bank report,
Loud and Clear: Effective Language of Instruction Policies for Learning
(
PDF
). Here is an unambiguous excerpt:
[Mother-Tongue Based Multilingual Education (
MTB-MLE
)] promotes higher learning outcomes in a subsequent
L2
. Students who become proficient first in their
L1
have a greater ability to subsequently learn an
L2
.… in South Africa, Taylor and von Fintel (2016) considered more than 9,000 primary schools and 800,000 student records. They found that
​
“
MTB-MLE
instruction in the early grades significantly improves English as measured in grades 4, 5, and 6.” (p. 16 – 17).
Labor Market Value Does Not Indicate the Best Way to Acquire Language Proficiency. Especially in low resource contexts, children who start school in an
L1
learn an
L2
more effectively than students who start school in the
L2
. (p. 26).
Principle 4: Continue
L1
instruction after an
L2
becomes the principal LoI. Some
L1
instruction continues to improve
L2
performance in important ways even after the
L2
becomes the language of instruction. (p. 54).
Thus, strengthening Kannada and other mother tongue education in Karnataka would bring all those benefits listed. Further, it would also enable better learning of English. The most effective path seems to be: other tongues through the mother tongue!

Faculty Perspectives
Indo-Finnish Research Seminar on Education — Charting Collaborative Pathways in
ECCE
Ira Joshi
summarises various aspects of studies presented in the seminar.
Azim Premji University along with the Global Innovation Network for Teaching and Learning (
GINTL
) organised a two-day seminar on 23
rd
and 24
th
September 2024 in Bengaluru.
The seminar titled,
​
‘
Indo-Finnish Research Seminar on Education: Charting Collaborative Pathways for the Future’
brought together academicians and researchers from three Universities: Azim Premji University,
University of Jyväskylä (Finland)
and
University of Helsinki (Finland)
. The seminar was meant to provide a common platform to discuss specific themes and issues related to education and research in the two countries through a mix of plenary sessions, roundtable discussions and workshops.
A clear policy thrust on quality
ECCE
and the concerns around it, makes it important that we come together to discuss these themes and deliberate on research topics that can further inform our understanding of and support the implementation of the policy on the ground.
The
National Education Policy (
NEP
) 2020
gives due importance to quality Early Childhood Care and Education (
ECCE
) for all children in India. It recognises that the first six years of life are important for children’s development and that learning is closely linked to good health and nutrition.
The policy underscores the importance of a play and activity-based curriculum as well as trained teachers so that children are prepared for learning in formal schools. This is also a landmark policy in India, as for the first time,
ECCE
has come under the ambit of school education with 3 – 8 years now recognised as the first stage in the structure of school education in India.
Children, especially from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds, lack opportunities to attend quality
ECCE
programmes which impacts the development of their school readiness skills that are required for success in formal schools. A clear policy thrust on quality
ECCE
and the concerns around it, makes it important that we come together to discuss these themes and deliberate on research topics that can further inform our understanding of and support the implementation of the policy on the ground.
It was welcoming to see that
​
‘
Play’ emerged as a topic of mutual interest and exploration, which in the light of
NEP
2020 and the
National Curriculum Framework for Foundational Stage (
NCF-FS
), 2022
is relevant and significant for the
ECCE
and research landscape in India.
The roundtable session on
​
‘
Pathways to quality early childhood education’
was conceptualised to engage the seminar participants in discussions pertinent to quality, equity, and inclusion in the learning and development of children from birth to 8 years of age. It was envisaged as an interactive session to discuss multiple issues related to
ECCE
both from India and Finland, and to explore any similarities despite the varied contexts. The session had four presenters, and each shared their work which was followed by a discussion.
The first presentation by
Anna-Maija
, Dean and Professor at the Faculty of Education and Psychology, University of Jyvaskyla, on
​
‘
Can research increase understanding of factors fostering learning and educational engagement’
laid out the dimensions of quality in Finland’s early childhood education and care (
ECEC
). It provided an overview of existing research themes and projects concerning young children. The presentation drew our attention to the range of studies undertaken at the University of Jyvaskyla and the importance given to diverse methodologies in research with young children. The studies were qualitative, quantitative or mixed-method research on a range of themes related to children’s development, participation and well-being.  It was welcoming to see that
​
‘
Play’ emerged as a topic of mutual interest and exploration, which in the light of
NEP
2020 and the
National Curriculum Framework for Foundational Stage (
NCF-FS
), 2022
is relevant and significant for the
ECCE
and research landscape in India.
The second presentation by
Bhuvaneswari Balasubramaniam
, School of Education, Azim Premji University, on
​
‘
Exploring early childhood transitions of children on the autism spectrum’
discussed the need to understand the challenges faced by children on the autism spectrum during their early childhood transitions. The study aims to capture the experiences of parents, teachers and early intervention professionals to gain insight into the nature of these challenges. it explores the strategies used by them to support children with autism. The findings from the research will be used to develop a handbook for parents on how to guide their children with autism spectrum disorder during the early years transition phases.
Rima Kaur and Pranalee Sharma
, School of Continuing Education and University Resource Centre, Azim Premji University were the third to present.  Their area was
​
‘
Co- developing
ECE
curriculum across Northeastern States’
elucidated the journey of co-creating contextually relevant early childhood education curriculum across six northeastern states- Nagaland, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Manipur and Mizoram. It outlined the approach and process followed in developing a state level contextual
ECE
framework, the challenges involved, and the learnings gained from this endeavour. The discussions alluded to the need for systematically documenting the process of State level curriculum development and capturing the findings from its field testing in the
ECE
centres.
The final presentation by
Shipra Suneja,
School of Education, Azim Premji University, was on
​
‘
Young children’s experiences in early childhood education settings’.
The presentation examined the lived experiences of children in early childhood education settings through children’s inquiries, their relationships with people and space, and their exploration of the learning environment. The presentation laid out the need to include children’s voices in the
ECE
settings.
The roundtable session allowed us to understand the nature of
ECCE
studies done in the Universities, delve deeper into the specific research topics and chart out potential areas of interest. As one reflects on the discussions, one can identify that the research done across the Universities is driven by questions that concern children’s overall wellbeing, development and learning. The studies were diverse in their approach and scope; their outcomes varied in terms of creating new knowledge on educational and pedagogical issues, providing practical tools for professionals working in
ECCE
, supporting parents and caregivers and informing the teaching and learning at the University.
By the end of the two-day seminar, we could identify several avenues for future collaboration beyond research. Some ideas that emerged were on co-developing resources and courses, conducting online sessions with students from the three Universities and organising guest lectures by faculty.
As one reflects on the discussions, one can identify that the research done across the Universities is driven by questions that concern children’s overall wellbeing, development and learning.
Clearly one can assume that the benefits from such academic collaborations extend beyond student learning. These can also broaden the perspectives of academia to examine educational topics from multiple lenses. For example, our Finnish colleagues conducted a workshop with the
MA
in Education students of Azim Premji University.
This workshop on
​
‘
Play based learning and creative problem solving’
was attended by the students who have selected Early Childhood Education (
ECE
) as their focus area. It was interesting as the instructor extended the concept of
​
‘
play’ in the early years to include what is known as
​
‘
risky play’. The concept of
​
‘
risky play’ includes any form of play that involves some degree of risk for those playing it. In early childhood, this may include play that involves climbing, hanging or swinging from heights, or fast paced games with uncontrolled speed like running, cycling, playing with risky tools and so on.
The hand-on activities in this workshop pushed our students to incorporate
​
‘
risky play’ in their teaching plans and they had to generate specific ideas on how this can be done. The session was perfectly timed as the students were preparing to teach young children in Government run Anganwadi centres as part of their semester 3 field practice.
The discussions over the two days of the research seminar highlighted several cross-cutting themes for reflection and future engagement. While this may seem like a good start, the question to ask is, how do we take these discussions forward? How do we sustain this initial excitement beyond the seminar to chart out any plan for future collaboration? As one reflects on the two days, it may perhaps be safe to assume that overall, there was an intent to have cross-country partnerships, either by specific groups or individuals.
The next step may perhaps be to convene in smaller groups online, identify specific ways to engage and create a plan. However eventually, the success of any such collaboration will largely depend on the individuals’ priorities, time and teaching commitments. And so, beyond this, one may need to wait and see what happens

Understanding Breakthrough Science Series
The expensive simplicity of Daniel Spielman’s mathematics
A mathematician and a computer scientist,
Mohan R
and
Ramanujam R,
help us make sense of the fascinating mathematics of Daniel Spielman, a name that turns heads in the math world today.
This year’s Breakthrough Prizes, sometimes dubbed the
​
‘
Oscars of science’, were announced on September 22. With a reward of
USD
3 million each, these are currently the most lucrative science prize in the world, topping even the Nobel Prizes! This time, eleven researchers were recognised for their discoveries in fundamental physics, life sciences and mathematics.
Daniel A Spielman
won the prize in mathematics for his insights and algorithms that
​
“
have been significant not only for mathematics, but for highly practical problems in computing, signal processing, engineering, and even the design of clinical trials”. While Spielman’s whole body of work is substantial, one of his achievements caught the special attention of the prize jury and that was his solving of the
Kadison-Singer problem
, a problem that arose in
quantum mechanics
but has implications for several other fields.
Spielman is no stranger to awards. He has won the prestigious Godel Prize not once, but twice, along with his collaborator
Shang-Hua Teng
. Computer scientist R Ramanujam, who is a faculty member at Azim Premji University, recalls listening to Spielman deliver the plenary lecture at the International Congress of Mathematics at Hyderabad in 2010.
During this meet, Spielman was awarded the
IMU
Abacus Medal (earlier known as the Nevanlinna Prize), which is announced once in four years alongside the Fields Medal.
​
“
One characteristic of Spielman and his collaborator Shang-Hua Teng is that they generally work on very hard problems. They don’t take up theory building in the abstract, but they focus on some well-known hard problems and work on them. They typically look at the heart of the problem from a different lens.”
Ramanujam marvelled at the fact that Spielman has been part of at least three breakthrough results.
​
“
This is very unusual. One is good enough for a career! And he has some way to go, so I expect there will be more from him,” he said.
Equally interested in Spielman’s work — particularly in his solving of the Kadison-Singer problem —is Mohan R, a mathematician and colleague of Ramanujam. Mohan is interested in an area of mathematics called C*-algebra, which is where the Kadison-Singer problem comes from.
Mohan and Ramanujam combined their expertise and their fondness for communication to break down Spielman’s mathematics for us.
What would you say was Spielman’s first claim to fame?
Ramanujam:
The first was actually his PhD thesis — about
error correcting codes
(
ECC
). Say I communicate with you on a channel. Some message reaches you, but how do we make sure that what you got is what I sent?
What I can do is, send you a code along with the message so that at the receiver’s end, you can do something on the code and check whether it is the right one. The message is after all made of 0s and 1s, right?
So, say that while sending, one or two bits got flipped, and that code can tell you that has happened. In fact, there is even a way of finding out where it has happened and correcting it. These are called error correcting codes. Spielman did some nice work related to that, which, in retrospect, proved very useful.
One characteristic of Spielman and his collaborator Shang-Hua Teng is that they generally work on very hard problems. They don’t take up theory building in the abstract, but they focus on some well-known hard problems and work on them. They typically look at the heart of the problem from a different lens.

Can you tell us about the famous Spielman-Teng partnership?
Ramanujam:
Both of Spielman’s Godel Prize-winning works were in collaboration with Shang-Hua Teng, a Chinese-American computer scientist. These two had a collaboration going on for a very long time.
One was a very nice piece of work called
smooth analysis
. So, the idea is this: Think of an algorithm — it sits there till some input comes, processes it, and puts out an answer. Now, you want to know how efficient this algorithm is for various kinds of inputs — does it do things fast, are there inputs that make it slow, and others that make it fast, etc. This is called the analysis of an algorithm.
Then there are optimisation problems. A typical optimisation problem is airline scheduling. Or say the University is trying to build its timetable. There are many people who want to teach courses and many students who want to take them. Somebody has the option of taking one from here, one from there. Coming up with a timetable is usually hard, computationally. It’s difficult to come up with efficient algorithms.
There is one technique called the simplex optimisation algorithm which has been there since the 70s and has been extensively used. In practice, it works very well. But simplex is terrible with some inputs. Even an undergraduate student can set up a counter example, some input, which will send the algorithm into a tizzy. So, there was always this question with such algorithms which seem to be okay, but theoretically, it is easy to make them look bad. How do you explain this?
Spielman and Teng came up with this idea of smoothed analysis. It says that when you have a method or algorithm, do not just take an arbitrary input and work on it. First
​
“
smooth” the input a bit, perturb it, then work on it. If there are kinks in the individual inputs that make your algorithm go very fast or very slow, the smoothing will even it out. And then, if your algorithm is really stable, it shouldn’t matter. This is called smoothed analysis.
This demonstrated that simplex is very efficient and smooth. This work by the duo taught a new technique for a whole field. It was a beautiful piece of work.

Another significant achievement by Spielman and Teng had to do with the good old systems of linear equations. We learn how to solve fundamental problems of linear algebra in school. For example, equations like 5x+3y+6z=72.
But, what happens if you have, say, 50,000 variables and 82,000 equations? Somehow you think that for a computer, it hardly matters. But, all kinds of computational problems appear. Especially if the equations that we’re looking at have some particular mathematical structures like integrals or derivatives — these are linear equations too!
One particular kind of linear equation called
Laplacian equations
is of great interest in physics. These are large systems of linear equations which, roughly speaking, involve integrals and derivatives.
Spielman and Teng came up with a technique for solving such equations. Here too, the word
​
‘
breakthrough’ applies because people had been trying all sorts of things to achieve this. But these two came up with an elegant solution. They call it expensive simplicity. When you wear a dress that looks simple, it’s actually very expensive. It’s a bit like that in mathematics. It is very elegant because it internalises a whole lot of very difficult stuff.
The jury of the Breakthrough Prize made a special mention of Spielman’s solution to something called the Kadison-Singer problem. What is the Kadison-Singer problem and what’s the big deal about solving it?
Mohan:
The origin of this problem comes from quantum mechanics, which is not exactly a field of mathematics. In quantum mechanics, there is a fundamental principle called Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, which says that at the quantum level, we can’t measure the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously in an experiment.
It is kind of counterintuitive to whatever we can do in classical mechanics — meaning, in real life. This raises an interesting question — how can we describe the state of such a particle that can be verified experimentally?
Then in the 1930s or so,
Paul Dirac
suggested that to describe the state of a physical system, you don’t have to worry about things you can’t measure and look at the things that you can measure. This means that despite the uncertainty principle, there is a way to describe the state of a physical system.
This was a time when mathematicians were trying to write quantum mechanics in the language of mathematics. They were trying to find out the mathematical foundation of quantum mechanics to explain the very counterintuitive stuff happening there. This brought about the birth of a field of mathematics called
C*-algebra.
In 1959, Kadison and Singer wanted to check if Dirac’s claim can be verified mathematically and translated the claim into mathematical language. This came to be known as the Kadison-Singer problem.
It’s not just about solving this particular problem but using the techniques developed in one and translating it into other areas. I think that’s one of the greatest contributions when it comes to solving big problems like these.
Mohan R
What makes this problem interesting is the fact that it’s connected to a lot of different theories. In 2006, there was an
article
that talks about equivalent versions of the Kadison-Singer problem in 12 different areas ranging from Hilbert space theory, Banach space theory, frame theory, harmonic analysis, time-frequency analysis, computer science, and more. What this means is that if you solve it in one area, simultaneously you solve the equivalent problems in many different areas.
This is a sign that this is a fundamental problem. It’s not just about solving this particular problem but using the techniques developed in one and translating it into other areas. I think that’s one of the greatest contributions when it comes to solving big problems like these.
How did Spielman manage to solve the problem?
Ramanujam:
Mathematicians felt that if there was an answer to this problem, it was probably in the study of algebra. So, they kept trying all kinds of stuff but they were not getting anywhere. Then somebody pointed out that maybe we can think of the Kadison-Singer problem in a combinatorial fashion.
Somehow, I think this caught the attention of Spielman and his students. They worked on this and finally found a solution, and they did it in a different field called graph theory. They thought of it as a network. The question was if you have a network, say a road network with towns, villages and roads connecting them, can you figure out the properties of the network by looking at some parts and sub-networks?
Nikhil Srivastav
a
,
Adam Marcus
,
and Daniel Spielman solved the Kadison-Singer problem, which was originally stated in C*-Algebra, in a totally different field of graph theory.
This shocked many people. It was like seeing people who don’t share a language of communicating with each other!

Yale News
It’s unusual for fundamental maths research to have applications, but in Spielman’s case there has been a lot of buzz about applications. Why is this so, and what applications could there be?
Mohan:
Spielman primarily works in algorithms. And algorithms have real-time applications in the sense that you can optimise lots of stuff — make it faster, more precise. Most of the problems he works on are inspired by real-life problems, so if you find a solution, you will have real-life applications.
Ramanujam:
Yes, usually anything which has multiple equivalent formulations like the Kadison-Singer problem has a lot of applications. That tells you that something deep is going on. And when something is so central that it can be said in different ways, and yet it remains a problem… applications are just waiting.
Now Spielman’s other work like his error-correcting codes has tons of applications.
Fundamental communication theory
is one, cryptography is another. His work in smoothed analysis is teaching computer scientists how to think. It has provided a new tool in their hands.
His research on systems of linear equations too has huge applications, because linear algebra is everywhere. We are talking about large systems of equations, like 10,000 variables! How can you efficiently solve them? I’m sure it could lead to very attractive applications.
In the last decade, Spielman and his co-authors have been doing very interesting work on randomised controlled trials (
RCT
). RCTs, as you may know, are used in drug and vaccine testing — we heard a lot about them during the
COVID-19
vaccine development.
Ramanujam R
Is there any ongoing work by Spielman you are following and are excited about?
Ramanujam:
In the last decade, Spielman and his co-authors have been doing very interesting work on randomised controlled trials (
RCT
). RCT
s
, as you may know, are used in drug and vaccine testing — we heard a lot about them during the
COVID-19
vaccine development.
We also need RCT
s
in many sociological contexts like education — to find out the effectiveness of some method. Now, there are fundamental mathematical questions about such trials. The thing is, it is not a good thing to do it in a genuinely random fashion because sometimes, you
want
to bias the sample. You want to ensure that certain aspects are given the extra importance they need.
For instance, maybe with the testing of a certain drug, you have to give extra importance to women of a particular age, right? So, the challenge, to put it in a crude way, is how to bias your samples and yet get good randomised control trials.
This is what Spielman calls
​
‘
artfully random
’. That’s a beautiful term. Is there such a thing? Yet again, his team is attacking another hard problem. I would say that’s the next Breakthrough Prize waiting for them. They don’t have any kind of dramatic results, yet, as they did with smoothed analysis, Kadison-Singer, or any of those. But I would say it’s a matter of time.
Watch Mohan R elaborate on why the Kadison Singer problem is a big deal:

Domestic Workers and the Challenges of Collective Action in Informal Work
Rajesh Joseph
(2018)
Recent work:
From
​
‘
Servant’ to
​
‘
Worker’: The
​
‘
Formalisation’ of Domestic Work in Bangalore
The focus of the research is the work and lives of
​
‘
Domestic workers’ (henceforth,
DW
) in Bangalore, especially their struggles to form collectives as part of their attempt to transform their subjectivities from
​
‘
servant’ to
​
‘
worker’, and improve their life and work situations.
Domestic work is precarious work constituting a large part of India’s informal economy. It exists within a political-economic context signaled by rising incomes of urban middle and upper classes and the existence of a steady supply of working-class women (from mostly stigmatised castes but across all religions) ready for domestic work. It is also enabled by a cultural-ideological context signaled by the preference to engage DW
s
as a normalised cultural marker for upward mobility.
Our research demonstrates the struggles of DW
s
, the dilemmas and obstacles they negotiate for their empowerment. It focuses on the collective actions of DW
s
in their workplaces, their families and neighborhoods, and within unions and labour-NGO
s
engaged in organising DW
s
for
​
“
formalisation” of work, demands for a
​
‘
decent’ wage and work conditions, and innovations in the form and content of their collective rights.

Engagement
Full-time
Development encompasses the establishment of social conditions that foster individual and collective well-being in a sustainable and equitable manner. Yet, the path to development has seen numerous debates and changes across various time periods and locations, involving shifts in concepts, theories, and practical approaches. Resolving development issues necessitates a holistic grasp of the moral and ethical underpinnings of development and its implementation, considering the specific real-world contexts.
At Azim Premji University, we envision a world that is just, equitable, humane and sustainable while acknowledging that the realm of development is animated by conflicting imaginations. We view
​
‘
development’ as a process as much as an outcome and realise that achieving such an aim requires engagement with multiple stakeholders such as the market, state, civil society and communities to find inclusive pathways, especially for the most marginalised and vulnerable communities.
Who should join us ?
At Azim Premji University, join us if you would like to
develop a historically and socially grounded understanding of India’s development journey through multiple lenses.
analyse the different approaches and modalities of development action by various actors (state, market, civil society, community).
conceptualise possibilities for constructive action grounded in ethical sensibilities.
apply relevant competencies to address current and emerging development challenges in India.
Why study with us?
The
MA
Development programme at Azim Premji University is unique as it adopts a critical inquiry towards development while being grounded in empirical complexities.
While the core courses in the programme provide a rigorous disciplinary grounding in the epistemologies and methods of social sciences, the mandatory set of field practice components provide a robust exposure to experiential learning on the ground. The programme consciously adopts a normative compass in approaching the question of development itself.
At Azim Premji University, we offer
high quality, rigorous programmes that prepare you for different kinds of careers in the social sector.
a robust and extensive experiential learning through multiple field practice components.
a diverse pool of faculty with academic and practice-based expertise in a wide range of thematic areas and geographies.
an opportunity to engage with the Social Enterprise Cell, Community Engagement interventions in neighbouring areas, sustainable gardening, and many other student clubs and activities.
a collaborative learning environment.
a vibrant, diverse and inclusive community.
student support systems at various levels, including academic and co-academic mentoring by faculty.
Programme Structure
The
MA
in Development is an 80-credit, two-year, full-time postgraduate programme. There are four semesters that include classroom learning and extensive field engagements. The programme will include 10 mandatory core courses, 3 mandatory field practice components and 7 elective courses.
The first semester core courses have been designed to enable students to grasp foundational concepts important for understanding of development through disciplinary lenses and tools of economics, sociology, and sustainability. In the middle of the first semester, students are expected to engage in the first field component of two weeks.
Semester I will be immediately followed by a 3‑week workshop-mode hands-on course on
​
‘
Understanding India’s Development Realities through Data’ that prepares the students to make use of publicly available data. This is an integrative course which helps students consolidate their learnings from the previous courses and field practice.
Semester
II
will build upon first semester learnings and introduce theories of development, state and governance and approaches to development action.
Semesters I and
II
include two research methods courses which help students understand the importance of evidence and its epistemological foundations, as well as research methods relevant for the social sector.
Put together, courses in the first year provide students with a strong foundation in development theories, ideas and action, as well as understanding data, evidence and methods.
During the summer break post Semester
II
, students go on a 6‑week field internship which is designed to help them experience working on a development intervention in an organisational context.
This is followed by a core course on programme management in Semester
III
. Having experienced the implementation from a
​
‘
doing’ perspective during the prior summer, students would be well positioned to understand what is required for planning, budgeting, implementing and monitoring an intervention.
Semesters
III
and
IV
offer the students an opportunity to enrol in 7 electives courses of their choice from among 45 – 55 electives on offer. Students will select 6 electives offered in semester-mode and one elective in a workshop-mode that will be offered in Semester
III
.
During the second year, students will also engage in designing and carrying out a field project. They will conceptualise and design a field project under the guidance of a faculty mentor during Semester
III
. They will spend 8 weeks during the winter break between Semesters
III
and
IV
, doing field work. Upon their return, they will work on analysing and communicating the outcomes of their field project.
Our courses are structured to help you synthesise different approaches to development. You will use tools to work in multiple settings – whether with government bodies, social movements or grassroots organisations. The programme will provide you a rigorous intellectual and ethical foundation through direct community interventions, social movements, research, policy and advocacy.
Course Structure
Core Courses
40 credits
In the first two semesters, students will be introduced to the foundational courses that will provide the socio-economic, political, environmental, institutional, and normative context within which development takes place.
Our core courses:

build a strong foundation for understanding data, evidence and research methods through a hands-on approach.
nurture skills and competencies including project management, social interventions to allow students to engage in development action.

The extended field practice components add up to a total of 16 weeks of time in the field, and 19 credits within the programme. In addition, many courses include day-long
​
‘
Practicums’, where you may go on field visits to different locations or organisations to understand ground realities and certain types of interventions.
Community Learning and Reflection
A two-week exploration of the life experiences of different communities across India where you learn through observation and reflection.
Field Internship
A six-week engagement with an organisation to participate in development action.
Field Project
An eight-week opportunity to ideate and pursue a development intervention that you are passionate about.
Total 80 credits
Classroom Practices
The classroom practices in the
MA
Development programme entail a mix of lectures, class discussions, peer learning, use of audio-visual materials, films, worksheets, field practicums and case studies to make complex concepts and ideas accessible to students from diverse academic and socio-economic backgrounds.
The courses aim to engage with plural perspectives on development issues, and bridge learning from both theory and practice. Many courses include guest lectures by invited speakers while some courses are taught by experienced practitioners to bring rich, contemporary insights from the world of practice.
Group work is given particular emphasis in the programme, given the centrality of collective learning and action in the social sector.
Elective courses offered in the workshop mode use hands-on pedagogies for building skills for development action. Several courses offer students opportunities to design and pilot ideas, such as those related to social entrepreneurship. The Winter Field Projects offer students an opportunity to conceptualise, design and implement an 8‑week field project, under faculty guidance.
Faculty members constantly invest in developing new and innovative pedagogical approaches to aid student learning.
For instance,
Janata Express
, a day-long simulation-based workshop has been designed for students to experience and understand the community’s worldview through their lenses.
Surveypura
, another interesting tool, brings a simulated village into the classroom for students to learn quantitative research in a fun and interactive way.
All faculty members teaching in the programme offer students additional support during office hours. The programme offers academic accommodations to students with certain kinds of disabilities, in line with University policies.

The Land Question in India
The course prepares students to employ political-economy– and anthropological perspectives to explain and analyse several topics that they may encounter in their fieldwork such as land acquisition, women’s property rights, Dalit-Adivasi land rights, and the role of middlemen in land deals.
Facilitator
Awanish Kumar
Programme
MA in Development
Offered At
Campus
Bengaluru
To explain the complexities of land conflicts underway in India and their links with development, students of
MA
Development will need a firm conceptual grip on what land is. Land has the ability to simultaneously exhibit multiple characteristics – of property, asset, territory, identity, dignity, security, spirituality and memory – when it encounters human agents. Students will also need an in-depth understanding of how land is governed in India, how the messy and labyrinthine land titles work in the country, how land gets entangled with the intersectional identities of gender, class, caste, religion, indigeneity and race, and how to handle land data. This course aims to fill the need for a course that covers these issues in the
MA
Development programme. The course will also work in alignment with the programme’s objective of
​
‘
creating reflective practitioners by equipping them with interdisciplinary perspectives from the social sciences’ – in this case the scholarship on land.
In addition, this course will provide students with a tool to unpack the complex theories of the state, commodification, enclosure and agrarian change.

Postgraduate Programmes
State and Governance in India
Understand the role of the state as a
​
“
key actor” in India’s social and economic development.
Programme
MA in Development
Offered At
Campus
Bengaluru
You may have wondered if the Indian state has done little for the well-being of its people. You may have even thought that the Indian state is a part of the problem in improving well-being of the masses. In this course, you will appreciate how the post-independence Indian state was imagined, and constructed institutionally, as a key actor for transforming our society and economy in a democratic way. The course takes you through some exemplary developmental interventions by the state, and their successes and failures. You will also recognize the state’s changing roles vis-à-vis other actors, such as civic organizations, in India’s developmental journey.

Areas of Interest & Expertise
Secularism and Indian Politics
Hindu Nationalism
Politics of Disaster Relief and Recovery
Philanthropy in South Asia
Relationship between Religion and Development in India
Citizenship in Northeast India
Biography
I am a political scientist by training and am interested in understanding the interplay between religion and politics and religion and development in India. I also study the politics of humanitarianism particularly in the context of disasters, the institution of philanthropy in South Asia and the question of citizenship in Northeast India in the context of Partition history.
My most recent book publication
Disaster Relief and the
RSS
studies the political implications of the humanitarian work of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (
RSS
) by examining the institution of seva (service) in disaster situations. This book provides a refreshingly new perspective of the
RSS
by recognising its
​
‘
compassionate’ aspects and understanding its appeal from the point of view of its benefactors.
My research and teaching interests are guided by an attempt to examine the limitations of the
​
‘
secular’ and the repercussions of the political project of secularism to suppress and de-recognize the non-secular experience.
I earned my PhD, MPhil and
MA
degrees in Political Science from Jawaharlal Nehru University (
JNU
), New Delhi. I started my career at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and subsequently worked in a conflict resolution firm named Meta-Culture in Bangalore. I have been associated with Azim Premji Foundation since 2010.
Currently, I am working on a project titled
​
‘
Religion and Philanthropy in India’ where I examine religious subjectivities and motivations for giving and the challenges encountered by religious organizations in an essentially secular philanthropic space.
In my free time, I love travelling to forests and gardening with my daughter.

MA
Development Field Project Fair 2024
Putting to practice their learnings, students present their independent field-based work.
The Field-based Project is one of the three critical field practice components of the
MA
Development programme at Azim Premji University, Bengaluru. The programme aims to enhance students’ research and analytical skills and their ability to engage with social issues deeply.
The Field-based Project is often an avenue for students to design and implement a development research or development action project of their interest. Students systematically design their project with faculty mentorship over three months between September and November. This is followed by eight weeks of fieldwork between November to January.
Every year, students from the graduating batch showcase their Field-based project work during the Field Project Fair. This is meant to help students gain valuable learning experiences in disseminating their work to a larger audience through academic poster presentations. The graduating batch of 2022 – 24 showcased their work during this year’s Field Project Fair in April 2024.
The Field Project Fair 2024 showcased the work of 160 students. Their work was categorised under 18 panels covering health, education, livelihoods, agriculture, financial inclusion, socio-political identities, rights of people with disabilities, governance, environment, food, culture, social enterprises, and
CSR
.
Agriculture and land rights
Farming is changing, and farmers have a choice between adopting modern practices or sticking to traditional modes – But how are these choices made and what are the complexities involved?
Students investigated why farmers in some areas were switching from paddy to growing crops like maize, tea and millets. Higher demand, better market prices and lower labour-money investment is what lures them in. However, these trends also bring challenges like lack of knowledge about the new crop and ecological unsuitability. The sustainability of shifting agricultural practices and effects of climate change was also investigated.
Irrigation trends were another area of research. Solar pumps are proving to be more convenient and increasing yield in one area, while excessive water supply in another region seems to have altered crop patterns as well as the dietary patterns of the village.
A third set of studies was done on the sociological aspects of farming – how absentee landlords yield power over workers, women’s struggles with land rights, and how marginalised farmer communities have benefitted from
NGO
interventions.
Sites of field projects — Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, West Bengal, Assam, and Meghalaya.
Caste and religion
These are two prominent markers of social identity and one’s location within them dictates the politics and narrative of an individual. Six studies with communities in a precarious caste-religion position explore their experiences.
In order to protect their heritage, the Agraharams of Kerala have been placed under a restrictive lifestyle by authorities. The study uncovers how different members of the community feel about it and the impact it has on their physical and social liberties. A different study in the same state focuses on how improper implementation of laws has resulted in unequitable distribution of land between different castes. Yet another case where provisions by authorities are failing to have any positive impact on people’s quality of life is the Musahars. They struggle to find mainstream recognition and employment and are pushed to survive via sub-standard means.
The focus of one of the presentations was the role of social media in furthering the
Maratha reservation agitation
and mobilising marginalised communities.
Two studies in the east explore the arcane and selective ways in which the
Bharat Sevashram Sangha,
a spiritual organisation, functions in the development sector, and the impact of the Bangladesh war on settlement patterns.
Sites of field projects — Assam, West Bengal, Bihar, Maharashtra and Kerala.
Education and Youth Development
Two students focussed on community libraries and their importance in creating a healthy reading and social culture. One of them even revived an out-of-service library by arranging funds, getting students involved and creating a thriving ecosystem.
Extended preparation for competitive exams is a huge calling in our country. Two studies focused on accessibility issues around this choice. Students from wealthier backgrounds are able to embark on this journey with more ease compared to those from marginalised communities. The situation worsens for female students who have added pressures of safety and impending marriage.
Higher education was one area of research where students led initiatives to bring awareness in villages about the merits of higher education and bridge knowledge gaps through digital platforms. The challenges faced by girls in accessing higher education, such as household obligations, early marriage, and discrimination also came to light.
With a focus on politics, one student probed into how some policies that seem well thought out at the top level are perceived negatively at the grassroots, while another examined the underrepresentation and dissatisfaction of youth with the status of student politics in various Mumbai colleges.
Skills was another subject of study – while the skillset that social work students graduate with at large, seem not to attract well-paying organisations on the one hand, the Matunga children of Maharashtra on the other are leaning towards the caste-based profession of drumbeating over school education since they can start earning at a young age.
Sites of field projects — Jharkhand, West Bengal and Maharashtra.
Environment, sustainability, and commons
Development and environmental laws create modern problems for the communities whose livelihoods are tied to nature. A group of students looked into a variety of such issues ranging from the ban on mining in Koderma, the rehabilitation of people for the Kohala dam, the shrinking of Koli fishing activities due to coastal redevelopment, the Sabar tribe’s possibly unsustainable relationship with the forest, to land rights violations faced by Dalits. These groups struggle with displacement, changing occupations and lifestyles and finding government support.
Waste management is another domain investigated by the students. Through the journey of waste-pickers, two studies trace how they go about sustaining this livelihood. Meanwhile the solid and water waste generated by the
petha
industry in Agra bears far-reaching environmental consequences and urgent intervention is needed in this industry.
In two regions, the locals have come together to revive a river system and in turn the lost ecosystem and agriculture it supported, and protest against Uranium mining in their protected lands.
Sites of field projects — Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Jharkhand.
Gender and livelihoods
Livelihood is not just shaped by economic forces, but also by social and cultural forces. Women working in the crafts and handlooms industry are prevented from becoming efficient and powerful. While a large majority are not allowed to switch to motorised tools that would optimise production or make certain crafts that are reserved for men, some new generation females have progressed to becoming weaving masters and handloom entrepreneurs.
Women in agriculture and pisciculture must dabble between household management and long, labour-intensive field work. They travel long distances because of which their safety is challenged and their honour put to question. The income they generate gets used up in paying off debts, household activities and transportation, etc.
One study also looked into the motivations of women participating in occupations considered non-traditional for females such as mechanics, electrical work, and petrol pump operation. They had a supportive family, community, or organisation members and continued to find inspiration in female co-workers. They aspired to upgrade their skills and move to higher positions.
Sites of field projects — Assam, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Kutch, Maharashtra
Health and wellbeing
The
UN
Human Development Index measures health as one of its core indicators. However, achieving health and wellbeing outcomes is not easy for everyone, especially in a country like India.
Menstrual and sexual health is not just hard to access but also laced with taboos. Three studies looked into how menstruation-related practices and awareness on sex, or lack thereof, affect the lives of girls and women. Cultural norms, extreme practices and social media add to the complexity of this terrain.
A person’s health is intimately tied to their occupation. In a set of studies tracing different livelihoods, students discovered the wellbeing issues individuals face owing to the nature of their work. People living in mining camps suffer through many ailments and poor living conditions. Waste pickers are exposed to skin diseases, back pain, and injuries because they don’t have proper protective gear. Carpet weavers work in poorly ventilated spaces for extensive periods, inhaling fine dust, as a result of which they develop respiratory issues. The employers in all such cases fail to provide even basic medical care, let alone a healthy working atmosphere. In another region, study into the lives of older sex workers revealed that they face livelihood issues and turn to dubious sources of income, because they are unable to benefit from government schemes.
Speaking of schemes, one presentation highlights the plight of
BMT
seekers (bone marrow transplant). This can be hard to source and very expensive. Presently, the government sponsors only one type of
BMT
, leaving many who require a different donor in a financial chokehold.
Three students focused on children – one exploring why parents prefer private healthcare providers over public health services and another raising awareness on cyber-bullying through workshops with adolescent students. The third revolved around
​
‘
care leavers’ – children who are coming out of institutional care programs. They face troubles in joining the mainstream for lack of proper documentation, financial constraints and social isolation.
On a positive note, one student traced how the lives of women changed for the better when their village got piped water. With improved sanitation, they spent more time with their families or studying and relaxing.
Sites of field projects — Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Kerala.
Labour and informality
Informal labour is a convoluted terrain. More so when looked at through the lens of gender.
Four studies shed light on this theme; Female construction workers get paid 14% lesser than men in cities. Rural areas see some parity, but the overall pay is far below minimum. The garment industry prefers that women work from their factories. This does mean stable pay, legal protection and social unity but at the cost of a toxic work life and health issues. Women do not prefer this arrangement and choose to work independently from their homes albeit irregular workload and income. Domestic workers narrate stories of being treated inhumanely, abused, and constantly living under the threat of being sacked. Yet, they persist in this profession to fulfill their families’ needs. Down south, India’s first women-led trade union shares experiences of how the effort gradually deflated because women wanted solutions to their individual problems and weren’t able to unite in a collective consciousness of workers.
Various life conditions compel people to take up informal work – Students in Pune are increasingly taking up part-time work in the catering industry to pay for tuition and other needs. Similarly, gig workers in Delhi are facing immense competition as more and more individuals join the force to supplement their incomes. Migrant labourers find themselves staying back for better healthcare, education and amenities even though they feel completely alienated in big cities. A heart wrenching account follows bonded child labour happening in the Maharashtrian Katkari tribe. The people who face severe social stigma have also been devoid of their livelihood options due to restrictions on use of forest resources. This has pushed the young into seeking child labour, often in highly exploitative conditions.
Coal mine workers are not involved in provident funds or health schemes partly because they’re unaware of their entitlements, but also because they’re kept in the dark by employers.
Informal work is often threatened by factory production. One student examined how artisanal weavers are not able to match – up with factory designs, volume, prices or market share.
Sites of field projects — Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala.
Livelihoods
Communities have historically sustained livelihoods via their surroundings. But how must people cope with increasing environmental degradation? A case study on fisherfolk of Kerala brings to light the occupational and cultural loss the community faces due to coastal erosion. They’re left with no choice but to relocate –moving to the mainland means giving up on the only work they know.
Moving the narrative to the people who do migrate in search of better work – students investigated various aspects of the life and work of
Rickshaw-pullers
of Kolkata, bakery workers in Satara, fish farmers in Bundelkhand, agri farmers in Chevella, bell-metal craftspeople in Satherbari, Sandal industry in Peenya, and migrant workers of Lucknow and Ranchi. Some problems they found were marginalisation, housing troubles, redundance of chosen occupation, limited career growth, threats to their work due to mechanisation, entry of private players and bureaucratic issues.
Two studies on eco-tourism showed contrasting views of the locals. While the people of the Tawang district of Andhra are finding ways to promote tourism in their community-conserved areas, the residents of Kas Plateau in Maharashtra, a highly biodiverse
UNESCO
World Heritage site, do not care much for the tourism this label has invited.
A presentation on Sevagram in Maharashtra showcases how this Gandhian-model village has found a new, valuable sense of community along with respectable handicraft occupations.
Sites of field projects — Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Assam, Karnataka, Telangana and Kerala.
Migration
Many livelihoods in India rely on migration. The conditions in which migrant workers live and work constitute a large part of the development discourse in India. In one study, brick-kiln workers were interviewed to understand why they chose to work in hazardous conditions despite knowing better. What came up was the lack of any other viable options. This work provided stable guaranteed pay and did not require educational qualifications.
When parents move for work, the lives of their children are also significantly impacted, especially their education. Three projects unraveled how children are firstly missing out on schooling by being home alone and unsupervised. The ones that move with their parents and do continue studying, face language barriers, discrimination and difficulties in attending day school. There have been some efforts in this area, like Project Roshini that teaches migrant children Malayalam to ease the language barrier, however, the students highlighted the need for policy-level intervention.
Children are not the only ones left behind when breadwinners move out of homes. Their parents get left behind too. One project looks at empty-nest syndrome and the rise in palliative care units and retirement homes in Kerala. While older people do find companionship in these places, there are issues of caste, gender and economic access.
Sites of field projects — Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Kerala.
Tribal development
The government has put in place several schemes towards housing, health, livelihood etc., to benefit the tribals and alleviate their status. Whether these schemes are accessible by the people they’re meant for, and whether they’re able to mitigate their issues became a research subject. Students found that improper documents, digital nature of schemes, pervasive traditional beliefs and lack of awareness kept the tribals from benefitting from these provisions. Part of the problem is the lack of participation by the tribal people in local politics, as researched by one student.
Changing tribal cultures involved two studies on alcohol consumption and religious identity. In the first case, tribal people were leaving traditional, home-made liquors for commercially viable, poor-quality alcohol, leading to growing addiction and disassociation from their cultural identity. The second study on Gonds showed that increased interactions with Hindu communities was warping their beliefs into thinking they belong to the Hindu religion.
Migration is another important factor hitting tribal lives. Four students investigated the causes and consequences of this pattern. Unable to practice their traditional livelihoods, tribal people work as construction workers, garage workers, scrap-sellers or take up jobs in metro cities. Their social status, lack of formal education and debt incurment put them in precarious positions with these jobs.
Tribal youth are more aware of provisions and try to access mainstream education. However, they face a lack of learning resources, lack of mentorship, family burdens, alienation, and health issues. A lot of them, especially girls, do not make it to higher education.
Sites of field projects — Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.
Urban governance and street vendors
Through nearly 150 interviews, students uncovered how street vendors go about conducting business. Their research highlights how the Street Vendors Act of 2014 has borne mixed results. In an attempt to organise this sector, the
SVA
has ended up relocating vendors who had been attached to their spots for very long. The police enforce rules in an abusive manner. Getting the license is expensive and complicated. The Town Vending Committees are not proactive and even partake in corrupt practices.
Four projects followed displaced people and examined how their rehabilitation has been. Stuffed in cramped and undignified spaces, these families make do with poor sanitation and access to public amenities, and limited work opportunities. They feel uprooted from their past and subordinated in the new accommodations.
Urban planning affects different members of the social fabric differently. Gurgaon’s rapid urbanisation has gravely impacted the city’s water table. Restoration efforts have not only excluded the urban poor but also pinned on them the blame for the decline. Meanwhile in Pune, a student looked into how public transport is experienced differently by city and suburban commuters.
Two other projects focus on reformative practices in the areas of manual scavenging and education in slums.
Swachchangini
tries to empower women by training them in specialised sanitation technology and making them financially independent. Several initiatives in Pune slums try to raise awareness about the importance of education, with fresh ways to engage the disinterested youth.
Sites of field projects — Bihar, Delhi,
NCR
, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana.
Gender and sexuality
Gender is a social construct that pervades the human body and seeps into institutions, policies and occupations. This set of studies uncover how this phenomenon affects people at a systemic level – from policies that are gender-focused or gender-agnostic to institutions like marriage which propagate gender stereotypes. The research into marriage also highlights how educated mothers can propel their daughters to a secure future but not at the cost of their married lives.
Women have struggled with accessing public spaces, remaining limited to their courtyards or grocery shops in the vicinity. One study finds that even the spaces that women do access are restricted in terms of what they can do there – like, they can buy milk from a tea stall but never pause to have a cup of tea from there. Besides access, safety is also a big concern for women in public spaces. A group of females in Lucknow have gone and learnt self-defense to bolster their confidence outside. This has made them aware of predatorial behaviour and stay prepared on the streets.
Anwesha, an autonomous feminist organisation, was the subject of research for one student. They have created a space for women to seek support from counsellors, legal advisors, paralegal clerks and community workers for personal and complex issues.
Sports has been a male-dominated space since time immemorial, but even modern-day games are failing to be inclusive despite the discourse on gender and sexuality. One student’s intervention in Ultimate Frisbee was to make not just the sport and coaches but the rules themselves inclusive and sensitive.
Sites of field projects — Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.
State, governance, and accountability
These presenters consider questions of representation, manner of governance, and the State’s accountability to its people.
One group of students looked at local governance in cities and villages. They found several problems like elites influencing elections, lack of appropriate skills in representatives and a lack of preparation in potential candidates. The students observed the gaps and conducted workshops and training modules in these areas.
When it comes to women participation in politics, issues like lack of training, proxy-politics and tokenism and passivity came to light. Several suggestions for reservation, capacity-building and awareness on patriarchy in politics were made by the presenters.
An interesting venture into the experiences of election booth officers highlighted the challenges this job entails but doesn’t prepare the officers for – electoral app failures, clashes between party workers, communal sloganeering and canvassing.
Very often, the State has passed regulations without a thorough understanding of its consequences. The demolitions in Khargone which evicted Muslims from their homes, the Ayodhya airport project displaced villagers and Bihar’s 2016 blanket ban on alcohol were three instances studied by students. The effects of these decisions impacted different social groups differently – while most people were displaced and marginalised, some were compensated for their loss. The alcohol ban rendered useless because the men switched to drugs and the women continued to suffer domestic abuse.
Sites of field projects — Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Maharashtra Andhra Pradesh and Kerala.
Social Enterprises, Financial Inclusion, and CSR
Two students made enterprising interventions in their locales. One piloted a social enterprise to reduce FMCG-produced plastic waste. He created a snack brand that uses paper-based packaging to serve the hikers and tourists in that area. Another came up with a social enterprise model to help cashew farmers produce a ready-to-consume item and turn more profit. This not only eliminated third parties but also employed more people in the village.
Women’s financial capacities were also studied in two different projects. Interesting research into how women involved in self-help groups contributed significantly to family income and participated in agricultural decisions also somehow showed less participation in their children’s education and ownership of assets. In Bihar, women seem to be hesitant of using digital payment methods on their phone. Digital literacy, fraudulent behaviour, and mobiles being owned by husbands are some of the deterrents.
Hassle-free loan systems have become pretty common these days. One such instant credit facility has severely impacted students in Hyderabad. The ease-of-use compels them to borrow money for gambling and personal use, incurring heavy and dangerous debt later. On the contrary, an Islamic interest-free loan system has helped people from diverse communities who have faith in the bank’s philosophy.
Lastly, one presenter made recommendations to make corporate employee participation in
CSR
initiatives more genuine and effective.
Sites of field projects — Bihar, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Telangana and Kerala.
Disability rights and mental wellbeing
The discourse on mental health and disabilities has gained significant momentum in recent times. This set of projects explores the lives of the two kinds of people involved – the person living with the condition and the caregivers. Both face different types of challenges and come up with ways to cope.
One research into patients with fibromyalgia revealed toxic self-perceptions and unkindness they subject themselves to, owing to social stigma around the condition. Another study on visually impaired street-vendors explored their agentic stance on being perceived as a burden, and also the difficulties they face in their endeavours.
Disability issues are further complicated by issues of gender. Focussing on marriage, motherhood and domestic life, one student sheds light on the bigotry and unfair expectations set on women with disabilities. Female caregivers, in one study, found solace in prayer and self-compassion amidst feeling overwhelmed, abused and choiceless. Speaking of caregiving, another research found that one of the main reasons behind high suicide rates amongst students was lack of social support and care.
Sites of field projects — West Bengal, Maharashtra, Telangana and Karnataka.
Culture and food
Four projects explored how food is the most everyday way of experiencing one’s culture. In cities where food habits are rapidly changing due to heavy migration, restaurants and food joints often change their menus to cater to a wide audience. There is a rise in the consumption of fast food among the youth, that is more cosmopolitan in nature. However, there are some migrant groups who feel nostalgic about their food culture and stay in touch with their culinary habits through cooking.
Language is another such touchpoint to culture and one school in Gadchiroli is creating an alternate education for its students by teaching them traditional knowledge in their tribal native tongue. The research explores the relevance of such schooling in the modern day.
It’s possible that one might feel alienated in their own land, due to politics or communal history. One student explores why this might be the case with some Hyderabadi Muslims and the reasons behind this feeling of disconnect.
Sites of field projects — Telangana, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh.
Water, sanitation, and hygiene
In one study, the views of household sanitation workers were recorded. While they find this job stigmatised and underpaid, they don’t think it has much to do with their caste identities and don’t seem to mind the nature of work either.
What urban folk might not even think twice about, the slum dwellers of Kolkata have developed an intricate social structure for – toilets. Two students unpack how people have organised the use of public toilets, dictating who relieves themselves first. Naturally, with so many people availing such a scarce commodity, unsanitary conditions, diseases and accidents are bound to happen.
Down south, Mission Kakatiya flopped because its implementation didn’t factor local perceptions about irrigable water, nor did it create awareness about how the execution is planned. As a result, people either abused the system or did not avail themselves of it.
A student’s work in U.P. shows the suffering of people who are forced to consume contaminated groundwater. With no affordable alternatives and lack of healthcare, this population now has heavy-metal contamination in their blood.
Sites of field projects — West Bengal, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.
Citizenship and identity
A variety of projects explored the concept of citizenship and identity. Some of the narratives are about:
A group of Dalit people who held respectable government jobs but were pushed into cleaning work after partition, and their fight to claim non-caste-based occupations. Another set of Dalit people who have found occupational parity but stunted cultural exchange.
The plight of the Miyas in Assamese detention camps who have had no access to health, educational or economic privileges.
The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, despite being a step in the right direction, fails to bolster the status of the community to fully assert their rights.
Two studies focussed on the reasons that lead to a strong or weak caste movement within institutions – The first with Matang and Mahar people who remain restrained in their efforts to mobilise their movement for better social participation, and the second with university students who find Ambedkarite student bodies more approachable and useful than
SC
/
ST
cells.
One student explored assertion of identity through the Bhim Geete counter-culture movement that is liberating women through songs of social justice.
Sites of field study — Assam, Delhi, West Bengal and Maharashtra.

Climate change: Science, adaptation and mitigation
Introduction to the three critical aspects of the subject- climate science, climate mitigation, and climate adaptation.
Programme
MA in Development
Offered At
Campus
Bengaluru
Climate Change is a significant and urgent problem that has been recognised globally as well as nationally. Over the past decade, the concerns of climate change have steadily become part of the developmental agenda. Development objectives affect climate change and are inturn affected by it. Achieving developmental goals (expanding the capabilities of people) is closely linked to climate adaptation and increases capacities to adapt to the threats posed by climate change on livelihoods and income. Secondly, addressing climate concerns of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions are often counterposed with pursuing development goals (improving energy use, infrastructure). Given India’s developmental challenges, the need for adapting to climate impacts (in the short and long run), and the pressures of acting on climate change in the here and now, there is a need for equipping students as future development practitioners to understand the subject matter in greater detail. This course will introduce students to the broader concepts, theories, and multidisciplinary nature of the climate change debate. It will be taught with a grounding within the Indian developmental context, as well as address these issues from the perspective of the natural and social sciences.
The course begins with an introduction to climate science to understand the phenomenon
of global warming caused by anthropogenic factors. It then looks at the distinct aspects of climate action i.e. climate mitigation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and climate adaptation as a response to the impacts of climate change. Climate adaptation will be the aspect that is explored in greater detail (in term of intensive readings and duration of classroom teaching). This is done in order to equip students with subject expertise to deal with short-term and long-term goals of Climate Change and development policy in India.
This course builds on the discussion of Climate Change across some core and elective courses in the programme, but seeks to explain it in a more extensive and detailed manner. It therefore tries to engage students with different aspects of the climate change problem in theory and practice. In doing so it seeks to foster amongst students, the necessary conceptual and practical basis, to engage with stakeholders and policy makers to deal with many pressing concerns within and outside the country. While doing so, it will
foreground the need for formulating developing country perspectives on these issues by emphasising the differences in capacities between developed and developing countries.

Migration in contemporary India
A course designed for future development practitioners, action-researchers, and social activists to understand the challenges faced by migrant workers.
Programme
MA in Development
Offered At
Campus
Bengaluru
Major changes in economic policies in India in the last one and half decades has made labour fragile, leading to unforeseen increase in pace and intensity of their migration in search of work within the country. To build a perspective on the phenomenon and its effects, it is imperative that we pay attention the history of internal migration of labour in India, theoretical approaches to it, sectors of migration, vulnerabilities faced by migrants, policy deficits on part of the Indian state and mobilizations to address these.
Just as migrant workers played key role in industries prior to India’s independence from
colonial rule, Nehruvian development projects too rode heavily on their shoulders. Migrants connect regions of the country by moving for work from one place to another temporarily, seasonally, circularly as well as permanently. They migrate within and across state borders and their movements trace natural [agricultural as well as non-agricultural] production corridors as well as industrial regions. In neo liberal India, migrants carry out the lowliest paid, hazardous, insecure, casual, feminized, conflict-ridden, forced, and more often, invisible work. Migrant workers’ vulnerabilities are manifest in their working as bonded labourers in underground sewers; living in inhuman residential arrangements like Kapashera; not being able to produce identity documents to access public services; and being the first to lose their jobs in conflict-situations like Kashmir. In fact, drawing on the vulnerabilities arising from these shortfalls, certain industries now prefer a mobile workforce over the native, and these include mainstream areas of work like construction, garment and allied manufactures, domestic work etc.
It is necessary to expose students of MA-Development to the fact that labour migration
challenges and fractures the idea of dignity of work and workers. They will learn that while
on the one hand, migrants are the most sought-after labour force because of their low costs, on the other hand, they live the worst lives as they do not have access to basic rights like secured contracts, well-defined labour processes, employment benefits, social security,
electoral participation, access to healthcare, rations, housing etc. Students will be introduced to lived experiences of migrants earning the lowest revenues in the country. They will learn that the absence of rudimentary things like identity documents, push migrants to the fringes of the socio-economic fabric and render them invisible both at the source as well as the destination of migration.
Students will develop a perspective that migrants develop skills, and travel through different sectors of work. They will also learn that migrants build networks among themselves, negotiate political divisions of caste, gender and religion, sub nationalism. Finally, they will see how migrants navigate corridors of migration, asking for the right to dignified work, access to social security and a living wage. To work meaningfully in the field, students will need to unpack the complex picture mentioned above, and of the polarization between migrant labour and capital produced thereby.

Postgraduate Programmes
Research Methods for Development Practice
Deepens understanding of the various methods for social research.
Programme
MA in Development
Offered At
Campus
Bengaluru
This course builds on foundational competencies developed in
CC4
(Foundations for Social Research and Reasoning) and aims to help students deepen those competencies by applying them in different contexts of research and action, ranging from survey design to participatory and community based methods.
For the purpose of this course, development action refers to a broad range of individual, collective and state actions for desirable social change. These actions often revolve around various kinds of organisational and individual works, often categorized as charity, welfare, entitlements and rights, resistance, etc. In addition, sites of development action can be very diverse, ranging from rural to urban; from community to state or market; they can be social, economic political or ecological, or focus on specific constituencies such migrants, women,
children, refugees, etc. Therefore, meaningful development practice demands a combination of
relevant knowledge, as well as a diverse skillset— mobilisation, communication, activism,
mapping, planning, monitoring, designing, evaluation, networking, etc.
This course aims to achieve three objectives. Firstly, the course will enable students to acquire basic skills in select social research methods such as a baseline survey, in-depth interviews, biography, social mapping, focus group discussions etc. This will involve guiding students through the entire research process after framing of a research question – review of existing literature, selecting method(s), developing questionnaire/​interview/​FGD guides (as appropriate), collection and analysis of data. Secondly, the course will help students gain familiarity with some common skills of development practice, such as community mobilisation,
PRA
, participatory stakeholder mapping, participatory problem analysis, institutional mapping, landscape mapping and so on.
Finally, students will be encouraged to think imaginatively to identify new mental maps of change, develop alternate collective modes of action, and collective imaginations of alternative socially just, sustainable development alternatives and trajectories (using approaches such as plays, songs, stories, photo-exhibitions or others).

GIS
for Sustainability
The course extends student capacity to analyse and understand the spatial dimension of these issues.
Programme
MA in Development
Offered At
Campus
Bengaluru
In recent years, geographic information systems (
GIS
) and mapping techniques have become very important for understanding issues related to research and practice in conservation, development, education, policy and related areas. Yet, since the technical training and software tends to be expensive and relatively inaccessible to researchers in developing countries, the use has been relatively limited and confined to specific institutions and areas. This course aims to provide Undergraduate and Masters students with basic mapping and
GIS
skills, via exposure to a free, open-source
GIS
platform (Quantum
GIS
). In the Undergraduate Interdisciplinary Studies in Sustainability curriculum, and in the
MA
Development programme, students are exposed to key issues in the domains of development and sustainability from multiple perspectives – using theoretical concepts, data and field experiences. The course extends student capacity to analyze and understand the spatial dimension of these issues.

Environmental Perspectives for Development
The history and socio-economic impact of development interventions on ecological systems.
Programme
MA in Development
Offered At
Campus
Bengaluru
India struggles with a host of ecological and environmental challenges, from deforestation to drought, and air pollution to flooding. These place serious constraints on the sustainability of India’s development trajectory. While these changes are largely economic and political in nature and driven by a few influential actors, the consequences of ecological and environmental degradation are disproportionately borne by the poor and marginalised communities.
To understand development in India, it is essential to appreciate the history of India’s developmental trajectory as shaped by its ecology, from pre-colonial and colonial periods through to independent, modernising India. At the same time, it is also important to frame these changes within the perspective of social-ecological thinking. The course will enable students to view India’s development trajectory using an integrated social-ecological systems perspective — understanding that the social cannot be delinked from the ecological. The course will also help them see how to use this frame to interrogate mainstream contemporary narratives of India’s development, placing them in a historical context to understand the political and socio-economic drivers of ecological change. In doing so, the course will focus on India’s production systems (agriculture, pastoralism, fisheries, forestry, mining etc) using a social-ecological lens. It will discuss alternate ecological ways of visualizing India’s developmental goals (e.g. Gandhian growth, eco-feminism, eco-Marxism). The course will also look forward in time, by discussing emerging developmental challenges for India in the 21
st
century that have ecological links: e.g. urbanisation, climate change, planetary boundaries, energy, and industrial ecology.

Sociology of Modern India
Students learn concepts and analytical tools to develop a sociological lens to approach social change and development.
Facilitator
Debraj Bhattacharya
Programme
MA in Development
Offered At
Campus
Bengaluru
This course will introduce students to the sociological approaches to the study of modern India through an examination of elements of India’s social structure, social institutions and its experience of social change, as well as the cultural politics of development in India. Students will be introduced to key sociological concepts/​ideas and theories in the study of Indian society including stratification, culture, power, legitimation and hegemony and theories of social change. They will engage in the analysis of social institutions (caste, tribe, gender, religion and region) and patterns of inequalities, including their intersections and transformations.
Students will be invited to analyse how social changes play out at different analytical scales, from the individual to the global. These changes would include among other things, the dialectic between technology and the social as this has come to shape our social relations profoundly. Moments of tension in processes of change will be engaged with as we analyse issues such as communalism/​secularism, movements around caste, and identity politics.
The course will trace the emergence of modernity in India through an examination of key moments in colonial and postcolonial India. It will critically analyse the categories of
​
‘
modern’ and
​
‘
traditional’ and their role in shaping the meanings and course of development in India. A sociological approach will enable students to gain an understanding of
​
‘
development’ as a sociocultural process through the dynamics of key social determinants such as caste, tribe, gender, class, religion and region. They will also examine how meaning shapes social action by analysing how beliefs, attitudes, language and media, among other forms of cultural production, reproduce or unsettle configurations of power and authority. Through a focus on the diversity and differences that comprise India, students will gain an appreciation of the multiple meanings and imaginations of identity and community that animate the politics of development in India.

Teacher Professional Development
Postgraduate Programmes
Economy and Development: The Indian Experience
A historically informed account of India’s economic development.
Programme
MA in Development
Offered At
Campus
Bengaluru
Specialisation
Economy and the market
Development depends on the evolution and functioning of the economy and its structures. And development practitioners need to have the skills to analyse and interpret development initiatives and interventions from multiple perspectives, including an economic one. In this course, we take you through the Indian economic development story through a historically informed understanding of post-independent Indian economic development strategy, including the role of the state, non-state actors and economic institutions in the fields of agriculture, industry and employment.
We take a sectoral approach in looking at dominant trends since liberalisation in 1991, with a focus on urbanisation and the informal sector. We also cover basic economic concepts such as poverty, globalisation, inequality, scarcity, efficiency, markets, and capital. You will learn how to apply these concepts to real life economic issues, interpret key economic data, identify sources and data gaps, and gain an analytical perspective on practical economic issues. Using this training in economics, you will analyse contemporary development issues such as poverty, informality, globalisation and human development.
This course includes lectures and student activities, and you will use readings, op-ed pieces, economic data, economic surveys on
GDP
, national income, and so on.

In this sense, she draws from intersectional feminist political ecology, particularly focusing on ways of being, seeing, and engaging with resource uses, cultures, and markets. She has used participatory methods (specifically arts-based) while working with communities.
She is interested in interdisciplinary collaborations with communities, practitioners, and researchers striving for equity and justice.
Revati draws upon her interdisciplinary academic training in her work and research. Her interest in human behaviour and natural resource conservation led her to her Bachelor’s degree in Psychology from St. Xavier’s College, Ahmedabad, and her Master’s degree in Sustainable Natural Resource Management from University for Peace (
UPEACE
), Costa Rica.
Her doctoral research was in political ecology
of (eco)tourism and intersectional community dynamics at Corbett Tiger Reserve,
Wageningen University and Research, Netherlands.
She has worked with community-based national and
international organisations on conservation and community rights issues in
India since 2011.

Pedagogical Tool
Surveypura: Learn Quantitative Research with an Illustrated Twist
Making learning concepts and methods of quantitative research more fun and accessible for our students with the simulation pedagogical tool
We designed a simulation-based pedagogical tool called
Surveypura
to support classroom-based learning of quantitative research methods.
Why a simulation-based tool to learn quantitative research methods
Conceptualising a cross-sectional study, detailing the sampling plan, designing a survey questionnaire, collecting the data, analysing it, and presenting descriptive and analytical statistics are important skills for students planning to work in the development sector.
Students are expected to be able to chalk out a proposal for a cross-sectional study, conduct the survey and be able to calculate the basic measures such as the rates (e.g., incidence of tuberculosis), ratios (e.g., maternal mortality ratio), proportions (e.g., proportion of households with toilets), and measures of central tendency (e.g., average land holdings in a village).
The process of conducting surveys is both an art and a science. While it requires the art of navigating a village/​community, establishing cordial relationship with the community members, and understanding the community’s needs and experiences well, it also requires a scientific temperament towards the collection and analysis of data.
For students pursuing higher education in social science, development or public health, these skills are often taught in a classroom setting with limited scope for field visits.
“
We are usually sitting in the class, but while using
Surveypura
, we were standing, we were finding things, so we needed to be alert. The process was more involved than usual. In my previous course, I had learnt sampling in a theoretical manner. But this time using the tool, it was much more enrichingand gave me more confidence to know how to do it.”
-Student
About
Surveypura
The tool includes a large illustration of a fictional village with 155 houses, alongside sociodemographic and health data on select parameters for each of the households.
The features of the houses, household characteristics, and the village have been carefully designed to give the visual feel of a village in the Indian context and to better assist the pedagogical process.

‘
Surveypura’: A Simulation-Based Pedagogical Tool for Quantitative Research Methods in Public Health and Social Sciences
It has been reported from various contexts that learning quantitative methods for public health and social research is challenging for students. Based on our observations of these challenges, we designed a simulation-based pedagogical tool called Surveypura to support classroom-based learning of quantitative research methods. The…
Surveypura
being an in-class simulation tool, may provide a better opportunity for facilitators to closely observe and address the conceptual concerns of students. It can be used by facilitators working in the domains of social sciences (public health, development, economics, social work, education, demography, etc.) and mathematics.
Our faculty members are using this tool in courses related to research methods and epidemiology. The tool can be modified to suit other contexts.
“
…it helps take away their fear for numbers which many times keeps them disengaged in class. This is especially important for students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds who may not always have enough resources to learn good mathematics.”

Postgraduate Programmes
Economics of Sustainability: Exploring Perspectives and Possibilities
What are the economics of creating a sustainable world?
Programme
MA in Development
Offered At
Campus
Bengaluru
The question whether economics and sustainability are at odd
s
with each other has been the focus of much research and debate. Could economics offer solutions to sustainability concerns that are the consequences of the currently dominant economic doctrine, and whether there is some economic sense in pursuing sustainability are two questions that a development student in India today will benefit from pursuing. Pursuing these questions can provide directions to our intellectual inquiry into the
​
‘
what’ and
​
‘
how’ of instilling sustainability into developmental change at different scales, in terms of both analysis and action. This also means engaging with the triad of theoretical grounding, contemporary economic mechanisms and analytical tools – all targeting sustainability.
The specialisation in sustainability offered to the
MA
(Dev) students at
APU
, consists of four categories of courses – core/​ mandatory; framing, elements and interventions; in that
sequence. While the
​
‘
mandatory’ exposure to interdisciplinary
​
‘
perspectives’ is
accomplished in the third semester, a specialisation student has to delve deeper into any one
​
‘
frame’ work among those offered in the third semester, and engage with any two
​
‘
elements’ — among energy/​ agrarian in the third semester or water /​land in the fourth semester. She also has to take the second mandatory course on
​
‘
strategies’ in the fourth semester when courses on selected interventions will also be offered. Specialisation in its current form envisages sustainability action in the form of justice, education and economic policies. Thus economics of sustainability forms an important part of interventions discussed in the specialisation.
‘
Sustainability’ here is considered as already understood by the student in its multidimensional and dynamic sense, as pursued in the first mandatory course of this
specialisation (Sustainability – an interdisciplinary exploration; Sem 3). This course builds on the foundation laid earlier the journey of a radical idea on equitable social change towards a green washing of whatever we as a society do. Thus this course will venture beyond theoretical exposition and analysis of sustainability in a world where pursuit of capital and consumption have to jostle with quest for social and ecological sustainability.

Biography
Mukta is a public health researcher interested in exploring how social conditions influence health. She is especially interested in understanding how social and gender inequalities intersect to impact adolescents’ health indicators.
Most recently, Mukta worked as a technical specialist with Population Council, New Delhi. She co-led baseline data collection for a community-based evaluation for a programme aimed at skilling in-school and out-of-school adolescent girls to reduce the incidence of child marriage in Rajasthan.
Her research work included contributing to an evidence synthesis of experimental studies from South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa that were aimed at delaying marriage, reducing teenage pregnancies, and improving labour force participation among adolescent girls and young women. She also co-authored research briefs, analysed data, designed research tools, and supervised data collection.
Mukta earned her doctoral degree in Public Health from Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (
IIT
Gandhinagar) in 2020. Her doctoral research focused on understanding the social determinants of menstrual health among adolescents across urban, rural and tribal settings in Nashik district, Maharashtra.
Her doctoral study on menstrual health included both adolescent girls as well as boys as she explored how gender itself acts as a social determinant to influence adolescents’ knowledge, beliefs, and communication regarding menstruation using a mixed-methods approach. Prior to her doctoral journey, she worked with
IIT
Gandhinagar as a Research Associate.
She completed her master’s degree in Public Health from Indiana University Bloomington in 2013 and her bachelor’s degree in Physiotherapy from Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (
MUHS
), Nashik in 2008. After completing her bachelor’s degree, she worked at Society for Education, Action and Research in Community Health (
SEARCH
), Gadchiroli as a fellow.
She looks forward to expanding her work on school climate and its impact on various adolescent health indicators.
Besides work, she loves Indian classical dance and enjoys reading Marathi literature.

Biography
She has worked at Loyola Institute of Social Science Training and Research (
LISSTAR
), Loyola College, Chennai as Research Fellow, and as a Researcher for the Social Science Research Council (
SSRC
) funded research project on
​
‘
Precarity and Covid’. She completed her doctoral research in Women’s Studies from Madras Institute of Development Studies (
MIDS
), Chennai, Tamil Nadu.
She has a Master’s degree in Women’s Studies from Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu. She has an undergraduate degree (BSc in Computer Science) from Nirmala College for Women (Bharathiar University), Coimbatore. She pursued Diploma in Education (DEd) from Sacred Heart Teachers’ Training Institute, Bengaluru.
She anchors her research around Women and Work in the context of Gender and Development. Her doctoral thesis critically analyses the work choices of urban poor women working in the informal sector. Mapping various informal sector works among women in an informal settlement named
​
‘
Kallukuttai
’ in Chennai, her analysis reveals the influence of various dimensions including caste location, gender roles, lifecycle events, and spatial context in women’s work choices.
She critically examines the development framework through the lens of gender to understand the significance of women’s work (both paid and unpaid). By bringing in various crucial aspects of caste, class, gender, and spatial dimension in the specific context of India, her work tries to understand what
​
‘
Development’ means at these intersections.

Biography
Asim has taught as a visiting faculty for the Study Abroad program of University of Minnesota (
MSID
) in collaboration with Environment Support Group, Bangalore. He finished his doctoral studies at Manipal Centre for Philosophy and Humanities, where his PhD thesis was titled
​
‘
Pedagogy of Non-Discriminatory action
’. Engaging with the tension between ethical and political education addressing identity-based discrimination, he explored the critiques of normativism and utilitarianism by feminist and Indian philosophy. He further conceptualized the role of body, experience and practice in the pedagogy of non-discrimination. This involved an ethnographic fieldwork in movement arts education which allowed him to bring aesthetic dimensions into his research.
Before his stint in the Humanities, Asim was trained in technology with a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from
IIT
Delhi, and worked in Technology and Development sector for four years.

Teacher Professional Development
Postgraduate Programmes
Gender and Development
What is it about being a woman or a man that particularly heightens our risks of being affected by certain issues/​problems?
Programme
MA in Development
Offered At
Campus
Bengaluru
Women comprise 50% of the country’s population. We live in a country which has some of the most gender-inequitable development indicators. Skewed child sex ratios, low female literacy and particularly low literacy rates among certain social groups, high levels of violence against women, high levels of maternal mortality rates particularly in rural areas of some parts of our country, invisibility of women’s work, lesser mobility, lower autonomy in decision-making, lower female participation in the labour force as well as lower political participation and excess burden of certain diseases are some of the gendered development challenges that demand that we view these problems using a framework that privileges gender and its relationship to other indicators of social stratification such as caste, class, religion, region and other marginalities.
This course will also explore whether these risks are distributed equally among all men and
all women or are certain groups of men and/​or women at an increased disadvantage
and if so why would this be the case? Since an understanding of gender issues is a
critical component of any program in Development, this course offers 4
th
semester
students the chance to engage with gender issues substantively with a focus on
development issues.
This course has two components: the first part aims at exploring
​
‘
gender’ both as
lived experience and as a category of analysis. It will trace how gender relations
have constituted and been constituted by the wider set of social, economic and
political relations- historically as well as in contemporary times. The second part
will clearly illustrate the ways in which unequal gender relations affects and is
impacted by development policies, practices and agendas.

Policy Research to find the Best Solution
Soujanya Sridharan
,
MA
in Development (2018−20) recalls how conscious reading from classrooms built her understanding of different concepts and issues in the field of development policy.
Soujanya is a Policy Researcher working with
Aapti
, a research institution working at the intersection of technology and society to find sustainable solutions. Their work spans many aspects of our digital lives — they conduct research, develop solutions, and embed them in policy and within organisations to achieve scale.
Before working at Aapti, she was part of
IT
for Change,
a Bengaluru-based Non-Governmental Organisation (
NGO
).
Soujanya is an avid reader and enjoys her work at Aapti thoroughly as it revolves around forging human-centric pathways to platforms and data governance, accumulating and analysing new regulations and best practices in the health sector across the world. She enjoys writing and this job has provided her with opportunities to write research papers, op-eds, and more.
Soujanya joined Azim Premji University with a clear vision to contribute to the field of policy and development. With a triple major from Christ University, this young working professional joined the
MA
in Development
programme at Azim Premji University for its multidisciplinary curriculum and excellent faculty.
“
The variety of courses offered in the second year enhanced my learning, the themes and subjects across the programme gave me opportunities to study courses that aligned with my interests.”
Soujanya Sridharan
“
The variety of courses offered in the second year enhanced my learning, the themes and subjects across the programme gave me opportunities to study courses that aligned with my interests”, says Soujanya.
Her Winter Field Project with
IT
unions was an eye-opener for her while making her career choices. It helped her look for job opportunities independently and made her take a chance in the field of Technology policy, a moderately new sector.
Soujanya values the importance of reading and mentions that conscious reading in classrooms has built her understanding of different concepts and issues in the field of development policy.

Urban India: Trajectories of Development
A course to help students discern sociological, political-economic, and phenomenological tenets on urbanisation and urbanisms in India that aid the students to map and analyse the interconnections, flows and processes of development.
Programme
MA in Development
Offered At
Campus
Bengaluru
Urban India is becoming a
​
‘
mirror’ and
​
‘
shining example’ for India’s growth, development, and imagination of the nation’s future. Today urban India continues to expand both in terms of size and its networks and consequentially has become the site of high intra-city spatial inequalities due to contestation over resources, spaces, and identities. Therefore, twenty- first century India’s urbanization trajectories make Indian metropolises and its rapidly growing Tier‑2 cities, immediate sites of critical intervention and analysis. More than ever before, cyclicity of crisis witnessed in Indian metropolitans to newer cities- induced by lop- sided knowledges of people, aspirations, resources and precarity- are becoming a perennial phenomenon.
A growing necessity for all Indian development practitioners working through the
bewildering diversity of people, deprivations, conflicts would be to understand how the
historical, structural, and symbolic systems of inequality, segregation and marginalization
operate through the grids of a city. In addition, to the core courses on foundational ideas that inform an understanding of Indian society’s itineraries of development and the wide range of electives that equip to think through various architecture and processes of survival and well-being in contemporary societies- this course would be a valuable addition for students to think critically about the urban spaces they encounter and possibly aspire for. Beyond the statues of governance and policymaking alone, the course would aid the critical evaluation of processes of urbanization.
The course contributes to the overall practice-based learning objectives of the University
curriculum. The course will enable a continuous process of rethinking about development. and its interventionist tendencies through the city as a space and a place. It will enable students to employ perspectives from critical urbanisms to explain various negotiations and contestations along the lines of caste, class, gender, religion that frames everyday life in Indian cities.

Agricultural Livelihoods in Contemporary India: Critical Perspectives
Who are the people involved in India’s largest occupation and who is a farmer?
Programme
MA in Development
The Census of India 2011 tells us that half or more of India’s workforce relies on agriculture and allied activities as its
​
‘
main’ occupation. Eighty per cent of the rural female workforce is also employed in agriculture in the country. This course will help you understand the nuances of agriculture by looking at the people and communities who are engaged in its activities. Who is considered a farmer and what are the difference between large farmers, small farmers, livestock keepers and agricultural labourers? What is the profile of a typical farming household in terms of landholding, crops, horticulture, livestock and income? You will learn of the history of policies and institutions that have shaped the course of agricultural production and value chains, and the ways in which farmers face exclusions and vulnerability due to their social location and shocks from the weather, health and prices. Finally, we take a look at the dire circumstances that lead to agrarian distress, including exodus from farming work and the scenario of farmer suicides. What can be done for the future of agriculture and its related livelihoods?

Biography
Gautam works on the institutional dimensions of drinking water and sanitation in India. He is especially interested in understanding (using a comparative frame) the reform-mediated character of institutions in the sector at a regional/sub-national level in India. In addition to political economy of water and sanitation governance, he is also interested in how dominant institutional cultures in the sector’s organisations shape their disposition to alternative imaginations of drinking water and sanitation provision in India.
The relationship between water and society interests him, especially aspects of how the ecology of water flows has historically shaped social and political organisation, and how modern hydrological visions and political exigencies shape ecological landscapes.
Gautam’s research interest also includes how the question of technology is implicated in the climate crisis. He believes that there is an urgent need to consider technology as an independent variable in human affairs – an issue demanding collective moral and political reflection. In this context, he is interested in interrogating the ethical dimensions of knowledge, exclusively produced through a scientific-ontological prism.
Gautam has previously been associated as a Research Fellow with Ashank Desai Centre for Policy Studies, Indian Institute of Technology (
IIT
) Bombay. He has a PhD in Technology and Development from
IIT
Bombay. He has obtained his bachelor’s and master’s degrees (both in Mechanical Engineering) from Coimbatore Institute of Technology and University of Michigan, Ann Arbor respectively.

Postgraduate Programmes
Theories and Histories of Development
Histories and theories of development across contexts, tracing changes in the meaning of the practice of development.
Facilitator
Awanish Kumar
Programme
MA in Development
Offered At
Campus
Bengaluru
Ideas, concepts and theories of development have undergone many changes in response to empirical failures, emerging realities, and new ethical and theoretical considerations. Development as an ethical-theoretical framework for human wellbeing traversed many continents, where it has shaped and reshaped itself through a dialectic of successes and failures, modification and adaptations, as well as by a combination of Sangharsh and Nirman by people and their collectives. In the course of its journey, development has embraced many fundamental shifts such as a shift from people being viewed as objects of development to becoming subjects of development; from human wellbeing seen in isolation to becoming intricately connected to ecological health; from the monopoly of one social and knowledge system to plurality of social and knowledge systems as constitutive of human and social resilience, etc.
This course aims at enabling students to form a historically informed understanding of development as an enterprise of social change, animated by pluralities of theories and histories. In addition, the students should be able to appreciate that development theories are historically constructed, where imaginations are constantly formed through new research, social movements and alternate practices.
Starting with an examination of the idea and origins of development, this course will focus on key theoretical approaches to, and debates on, development and examine their analysis of the causes and dynamics of social, economic and political change. In doing so, the course will enable students to develop a critical understanding of the discourse of progress that animates the idea of development, examine the construction of the category of the
​
‘
Third World,’ and query the desirability of development. In addition, the course will also consider important challenges to development from anti-colonial struggle, various social movements, and assess the role of international institutions in managing development and its tensions. Students will be introduced to perspectives on development from not only the
​
‘
developed’ world but also theorisations and experiences of development from across the Global South, including that from India.
The structure of the course will draw from a range of theoretical perspectives including, but not limited to, liberal, Marxist and post-structuralist analyses of development. The topics will cover the rise of modern capitalism, colonialism, modernisation theory and its critiques, and the role of national states and international institutions, globalisation, the turn towards participatory development, feminist, Gandhian, and sustainability perspectives on development, and notions and practices of development that fuel alternative visions of the future.

Dalits: State and Development
Engages critically with the
​
‘
Dalit Development Question’-i.e, how have Dalit communities engaged with the Indian State, and in turn, how has the State responded to that question both in colonial and post- colonial India.
Programme
MA in Development
Offered At
Campus
Bengaluru
Is there any need to examine Dalit question separately in Development? If the answer is yes, how does one understand Dalit question in Development? What has been Ambedkar’s analysis of caste and how that analysis forced the State both in colonial and post-colonial India to take up the cause of the Dalits in its larger Development question? Why and how the State is indispensable in the development of the Dalit constituency? While the need for an interrogation of some of these questions provide the basis as well as rationale for an elective course on the Dalit constituency, the following note provide a brief background:
Dalit, a term that has become synonymous with the
​
‘
ex-Untouchables’, is the name that many Scheduled Castes, especially politically aware individuals have chosen for themselves. The term means
​
‘
oppressed’ and highlights the persecution and discrimination faced by them in their everyday lives. They neither have a designated space nor recognized position within the official body of the Chaturvarna Vyavastha, the four-fold Varna system, of the
Brahmanical social order. This lack of position in the Varna order not only excluded them
from the Hindu social universe but essentially excluded them from all other arenas of human activity in the Indian sub-continent. In a way, there is a clear-cut relationality between the marginalization of the Dalits in the country’s socio-economic, political, and cultural arenas and their positionality in the hierarchically organized Hindu social structure.
It was Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, who for the first time not only systematically analysed the caste
question but also rather forcefully argued for the intervention of the State in the cause of the Dalit constituency. Again, it was largely on account of his arguments and efforts that the State – both in colonial and post-colonial India, taken several measures such as the abolition of the practice of Untouchability and institutionalization of reservations for the development of the Dalits. Although these measures facilitated the inclusion of a few of the Dalits, they did not result in the disappearance of caste either from the public or private lives of individuals or communities and post-colonial India. Indeed, the public presence of caste, both in popular and public discourses, in contemporary India is much more articulated than it was some four or five decades ago, when the institutional hold of caste was much stronger. In this context Dalits have taken to the path of democratic politics. The idea behind their vigorous participation in democratic politics is primarily to gain a respectable position in the upper castes-dominated political space and usher in changes in the caste-centric socio-economic and cultural spheres.
If this has been the brief background to the more complicated and nuanced Dalit question
and their politics in contemporary India, this Course aims to examine the Dalit question from different axes – historically and contemporaneously and analyse the impact of the State-led development upon the Dalits.

Social Interventions
This course enables students to understand deliberated and strategic actions for social change by analysing the subjects, sites and modes/​modalities of social action.
Programme
MA in Development
Offered At
Campus
Bengaluru
Development practitioners are expected to engage with state and non-state actions that aim to intervene in the status quo, reduce inequalities and exclusions, enhance democratic space and deepen citizenship. The trajectory of social interventions in India can be traced broadly to three periods — colonial modernisation, followed by national development and thereafter, globalisation. The landscape of social interventions is broadly characterised by the state and its policies and programs, and the collective actions of communities in resistance, collaborations or petitioning the state for greater democratic participation, dignity and welfare. While the colonial moment of social reform ushered in modern education, private property rights, and modern political institutions on to India’s social and political landscape, it also saw rise of anti-colonial struggles, secularism, peasant and workers’ movements which shaped some of the critical state policies like land reform, reservations and labour reforms. In more recent times, there has been an increasing role of the non-state collective actions in demanding greater accountability and productive collaborations, which have helped shape India’s social policies and actions including
NREGA
,
FRA
,
RTE
,
NRHM
to name a few. At the same time, several non-state actions have established a legitimate space in the landscape of resistance, as evident in anti ‑acquisition, antidam, environmental, and women’s movements.
This course aims to provide a historicized understanding of India’s state and non-state social interventions with three objectives: First, it will help students understand the nature and role of social interventions in addressing inequalities, and widening and deepening democracy, through the study of selected social interventions. Secondly, the course will help students comprehend the plurality and legitimacy of various kinds of interventions in the social space. And finally, the students will be enabled to appreciate the dialectical relationship of non-state and state social action, and how they shape each other and how the present day interventions are shaped
by the experiences of the past.
The structure of the course will follow three mutually related but distinct
​
‘
sites’ of interventions — Subjects such as labour, women, farmers and adivasis; Policies such land reforms, green revolution,
MNREGA
, and the third, Modes such as yojonas (e.g. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna), missions (e.g.
NRHM
), social movements, philanthropies (e.g. Ramkrishna Mission). While engaging with these sites, the course will acknowledge the local social dynamics and the role of local leaders in (re)shaping social interventions. These
​
‘
sites’ will help the students appreciate a few key questions for engaging in social interventions as development practitioners; What are the ethical imperatives and challenges of intervening in the lives of others? How state and citizen actions deepen democracy and citizenship? How such interventions create conflicts and how do might we mediate conflict-ridden situations? Through such engagements students will gain an understanding of the historical, ethical and political legacy and dilemmas of social change that they stand to inherit as development practitioners.

Women’s postpartum challenges and their coping strategies in rural India
Kanchan Patole
shares insights from 15 in-depth interviews conducted as part of field practice in Dhuma block, Seoni district, Madhya Pradesh.
Postpartum, the period from childbirth to 42 days post it, is crucial for both mother and child. After childbirth, with the attention shifting to the child, it often leaves the mothers feeling neglected. The existing literature around postpartum period primarily uses a biomedical lens, overlooking the socio-cultural and health service accessibility that shape the health experiences among mothers.
It is critical to study the experiences associated with the postpartum period among women living in the rural areas as their health vulnerabilities are far more complex due to the local dynamics, a strong cultural hold and norms that influence their experiences and agency. Dhuma block in Seoni district of Madhya Pradesh was selected to study the challenges, cultural norms, support mechanisms and coping strategies employed by women in the postpartum period.
The findings reveal the complexities of the postpartum lives of women, where sex of the newborn significantly influences the postpartum care that they receive.
15 in-depth interviews were conducted with women belonging to different castes and educational backgrounds on Village Health and Nutrition Day and during home-based newborn care visits. The findings reveal the complexities of the postpartum lives of the women where sex of the newborn significantly influences the postpartum care and rest. Women with male newborn experience increased confidence, improved household relationships, as compared to women with female newborns. A respondent said,
​
“
Bahot chinta hoti thi didi is delivery se pehle, yaha pe baccha hona zaruri hai.”
[I was immensely worried before giving birth to my child. Here, having a male child is important].
The desperation to have a male child is such that families move towards faith healers, adding to the complexity. Women end up with multiple pregnancies, with dominating in-laws around.
Some girl children are made to wear amulets around their necks, believed to protect them from illnesses. Image credits: Kanchan Patole
“
Gaon me toh bacche nahi ho toh bolte hain. Saas bhi acchese nahi baat karti thi toh alag ho gaye. Bahot elaj karvaye. Bahar bhi dikhvaye. Fir ab 12 – 13 saal me baccha hua
,” [People talk in our village if there is no baby. My mother-in-law did not talk to me properly so we started living separately. I underwent a lot of treatments. We also went outside our village for treatment. 12 – 13 years later, now I have a baby], said a respondent.
Cultural practices like
Chhati
(where women are not allowed inside the kitchen as they are considered
​
‘
impure’ until the newborn’s
naal
(umbilical cord) doesn’t fall off
, further complicate the mother’s recovery, which restricts food intake for seven days to anything except jaggery
laddu
and
harira.
Gud ke laddu
, made with jaggery, are prepared by the family for women to consume during the postpartum period. Women, except those who undergo a c‑section, are given this during the
chhati
period and after.
Nowadays, families buy readymade ingredient mixtures from
kirana
stores to prepare the laddus. The ingredients are listed on the package.

Joint family structures, support and timely information from ASHA
s
(Accredited Social Health Activists) — community health workers — and keeping in regular touch with the maternal family members turned out to be coping mechanisms for women in the postpartum stage.
While factors like caste, class and patriarchy shapes the postpartum experiences, the sex of the child emerged as the most significant determinant of maternal ease or distress, overriding other factors.

Public Health Care, Rights, and Accountability
The course aims to equip the students with the perspectives of human rights and social accountability, to apply this framework to understand the health rights of communities, and to learn tools and techniques for strengthening the public healthcare system.
Programme
MA in Development
Offered At
Campus
Bengaluru
A robust public health care system is central to the fulfilment of the
​
‘
right to the highest attainable standard of health,’ to a holistic human development and to the realisation of citizenship. However, several factors have resulted in the weakening of the public health care system. These include, amongst others, the dilution of policy impetus to strengthen public health care system, an ecosystem that has liberalised the private-commercial health care, systemic lacunae in fixing accountability, and more importantly the absence of large-scale civil society engagement with the health rights issues to address health inequities. The experiences and evidence world-over has pointed to the importance of adopting the human rights approach and frameworks to strengthen the public health care system. Development practitioners with the necessary theoretical understanding, perspectives and skills to engage both with the communities as well as the public health care system, have the potential of addressing the issues of health inequities and integrate accountability approaches towards strengthening public health care. Primary health care that has been organised through primary health centres (PHC
s
), sub-centres will be taken as the institutional framework to illustrate to students the idea of public health care and as the site of community and public health care interface.
This elective builds on the foundations of core courses that include State, democracy and civil society, and social interventions.

Exhibition of learnings from the Field
MA
Development Field Project Fair 2023
Independent field-based work by students after learning about practical realities and gaining experience in participative and empathetic action
The Field Project is one of the three critical field practice components of
MA
Development programme which aims to enhance the research and analytical skills of students and their ability to engage with a social issue in-depth.
Students can design a development project of their interest in a rigorous and systematic way over a period of three months, between September and November. This is followed by eight weeks of fieldwork from November to January. They are guided throughout the process by faculty mentors.
One of the learning objectives of the Field project is to disseminate students’ work to a larger audience. To enable this, the Field Project fair is organised, where students display their work through academic poster presentations.
Based on the project topic, the work of more than 160 students was categorised under 20 different panels like agriculture, education and development, water and commons, land rights and identities, etc.
This year, for the first time, there was a dedicated panel featuring the lives and rights of people with disabilities. Though the Act upholding the Rights of people with disabilities is established in India, the projects by students bring to light how inadequate and often ill-thought the execution of the Act is.
Given below is a peek into some of the panels at the Field Project Fair 2023:
Health and Wellbeing
For a country like India that produces medical graduates in huge numbers, healthcare ironically seems to be a great matter of concern. A series of research displays brought into light the plight that lack of quality healthcare brings about in rural and urban areas.
Inaccessibility to healthcare, especially in villages, the socio-religious bias that healthcare practitioners follow, undermining the psychological impact that negligence might have, are some issues that the panel covered.
The victims of these issues are present across castes and genders, regardless of the rural-urban context. Family dynamics and education, needless to say, play an important role in determining medical healthcare status.
The majority of studies focused on how women in particular are victims of poor healthcare systems and lack of sensitisation in society. Ranging from denial of treatment on bigoted grounds to Muslim Women to unattended hypertension, women in India are going through severe wellness issues.
Although a lot of institutions and NGO
s
, along with Government initiatives, are working towards healthcare issues, the on-field eye-opening moments shared by the researchers give reason to believe that implementation and the just practice of these policies are yet to be achieved.
Gender and Sexuality
Gender and sexuality are very broad and abstruse terms that encompass some major conflicts in Indian society and reflect on the socio-political backwardness of some regions.
On humanitarian, egalitarian and cultural norms, the students, in this panel, disclosed the sense of injustice that gulfs around biological sex, gender studies, and perception of feminism in a larger Indian context. These themes also overlapped with healthcare issues as the living conditions of many of the victim participants are indigent and weak. Access to medical facilities and proper healthcare is beyond their reach.
The panel vastly covered a plethora of gender-centred issues, starting with the unheard voices of trans-men and the overall treatment of the transgender community in Kerala.
Taking the ideal menstruation environment as a theme, one of the projects looked at the attitude towards pain and sanitation from the lens of adolescent girls from underprivileged urban localities of Meerut. Caregiving is often only looked at through a woman’s perspective, but one of the projects also highlighted the role of fathers and the impact a father figure has on the socio-academic upbringing of children.
Another topic of interest was queer psychology. From learning about the
​
‘
Dom Community’ in a comparative study format to sexual and reproductive practices in the tribal culture of the Bhils in Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh, this panel dealt with gender and sexuality in an all-around fashion.
Gender and Livelihood
The themes of this panel were closely associated with the Gender and Sexuality panel, however, the key highlights from all the presentations of this panel focussed on the relation of gender and livelihood — incorporating incomes, jobs, dignity, and stability.
Students studied how some occupations hamper the socio-economic lives of women. For example, one of them studied Archestra, an erotic Bhojpuri dance form, which sees several young women joining the troupe for income and livelihood in Bihar. Another one looked at one of the major occupations for women in Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district— the production of liquor out of naturally growing Mahua flowers.
The panel also provided glimpses into the situation of half-time labouring women, the bargaining power women hold in a household in Tangra Slum of Kolkata, and also the role of women entrepreneurs in the field of garbage collection in Pune city.
Observations in one project uncovered certain strategies employed by authorities to keep communities (in this case the transgender community) hidden. Questions regarding the treatment of women, not only in the sphere of work but also in their own households, was a recurring theme.
Another common observation was that of husbands migrating to different states for better employment opportunities, taking their wives along with them to perform reproductive labour while they worked during the day. These women often took up home-based jobs to occupy themselves while their husbands were away – often textile-based ones like pasting gems on kurtas, garment alterations, and in some cases, creating sequins and
bindis
.
An interesting observation from the study on home-based workers of Subhash Nagar was that the women would all sit on the thresholds of their houses in the evening, chatting as they worked, creating a sense of community for everyone. The study in the Zurrantee tea garden of Jalpaiguri uncovered the cycle of debt that women fell into while utilising the microfinance initiatives available by different self-help groups (
SHG
) set up for these purposes.
When one speaks of earning for the family or for oneself, it insinuates different implications for men and women. A general observation from this panel was that when women earn, it is not adequately appreciated and often is not associated with that sense of esteem.
Ecology and Disaster Management
In this panel, students presented their research on topics relating to issues like disaster relief in areas prone to natural disasters, the consequences of natural disasters on the daily lives of communities, possible remedies, and more.
The research sites included Chellanam (Kerala), Baghmara (Jharkhand), Nolia Nuagam (Odisha), Malana and Choj-Brahmaganga (Himachal Pradesh), and Chhattisgarh. For all the students, these field sites were either in or near their hometowns, and they were thus well acquainted with the problems faced by those communities.
A point that seemed to come up in most presentations was the lack of awareness of the citizens in the ways a disaster can be dealt with (responses), and of the schemes put in place by the government for supporting them in the aftermath of a disaster.
In a lot of cases, it was observed that the government aid, required in the critical 48 hours after a disaster struck, either arrived late or was inadequate. Cyclone shelters were poorly made, causing people to stay in their houses rather than evacuate to these shelters when the cyclone hit.
Tribal communities
The panel on tribal communities featured studies from the states of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh.
The presentation included a comparative analysis of women tribal Farmer Producer Companies (
FPC
) on the effectiveness of service delivery to its members, the role of public participation in the development of Gond tribes of Gadchiroli district, understanding Natural Resource Management (
NRM
) through indigenous knowledge systems, a case study of Gond Adivasi families in Madhya Pradesh, and the role of a crèche in the lives of tribal communities of Madhya Pradesh.
Sociology of Food
Indian cuisine comes with a lot of affluence and demands and has more impact on the social lives of people than one could imagine. Food is closely related to health and diet, which intertwines with a lot of social conflicts that other panels covered.
In India, apart from dietary concerns, ethical and religious issues, accessibility issues, and climate change play a crucial role in determining one’s regular diet. Since the country has a profusion of agricultural and animal-based varieties of foods, especially with a vast socio-economic regional difference, the sociology of food gets tricky and conflicting in various parts of the country.
The students who took interest in exploring the culinary patterns of the nation followed through stories such as consumption of beef in context with the Bhadralok politics, livestock grazing patterns, authentic recipes native to Uttar Pradesh and how they came into being, deteriorating crop varieties and its effects in Uttar Pradesh.
This panel was a riveting intersection of agro-environmental practices, socio-religious views on meat consumption, and a comment on how society has come to assign certain food to certain sets of people.
Urban Governance
Students evaluated and traversed the conditions of people in urban landscapes and how governance plays a role in shaping communities.
Recent trends in local urban administration, upliftment of oppressed communities in urban areas, provision of facilities, the relation of municipal corporations with corporate stakeholders, and revenue collection were some prominent themes of this panel.
One of the students explored the urban localities of Patna, Bihar, and highlighted the severe inhumane conditions that manual scavengers have to go through – the inaccessibility of water, poor construction of sewer lines, misconduct and more.
Another student actively participated in an intervention-based project. He churned the wheels of a rusted local market system (
Santhe,
in Kannada) that upholds regional economic significance and ought to continue for local development.
Reviving local santhe
has received a positive nod from the local panchayats and will work towards reinstating a local
santhe
of its own. It is an example of how on-field work and research can lead to social progress.
Disability Rights
Disability rights is an issue that is often sidelined and considered unworthy when it comes to social change. This panel brought into the spotlight the difficulties and struggles of disabled individuals.
From how the individuals acquired the disabilities, and their day-to-day problems, to ways in which others can assist them – students had the opportunity to associate and engage with the lives of these individuals and present a close reflection on their studies.
The panel members spoke of visual impairments, the plight of individuals with an autistic disability, and locomotor disability. It aimed at highlighting the indifferent treatment that disabled individuals in the country go through.
Youth and Development
This panel featured presentations that delved into topics like youth aspiration and higher education in economically backward regions, like the tea plantations on Kannan Devan Hills, Kerala, and Hospete, Karnataka.
A student visited the slum areas of Nagpur and Wardha, Maharashtra to research the role of a community library in a region where education for children was given less importance.
The topic of sexuality and the need for sexual education was brought up in two presentations, that highlighted the role of sexual education and its awareness in schools and universities, in preventing further crimes.
One of the observations was that often, victims of sexual harassment, physical or verbal, did not recognise their experiences as ones of sexual harassment, and the perpetrators were allowed to continue with their ways.
Collective Action
In this panel, themes of unity, solidarity, and protest were in play. Communities, throughout the country, stand together to secure justice against one common factor that unites them.
The projects of this panel closely studied what impact a united front can have on several issues and how it differs from fighting for our individual causes. It also looked at how
​
‘
action’ can be taken on a mass level, through protests, strikes, non-violent agendas, legal procedures, and other means. It also shed light on the constructive effects that getting together as a community can have.
The panel displayed case studies and issues leading to union movements. Some students studied the Sadhana Forest Community, the unionisation of female domestic workers and its correlation to bargaining power, and understanding solidarity networks.
There were also case studies on the protests against Vadhvan port project, in Maharashtra; Pakri-Barwadih coal mines, in Jharkhand; and the Pombilai Orumai trade union case.
Sustainability
Sustainability was a recurring theme of utmost relevance in the sense that it offers solutions to a lot of modern-day techno-environmental conflicts and fallouts. At Azim Premji University, sustainable means of livelihood and practices are encouraged.
The projects from this panel reflected how a sustainable lifestyle can function in reality, the practical issues of implementing it, and how it works out financially.
This panel covered a range of issues such as waste management in Jalori Pass, Himachal Pradesh; the culture of Maldhari Community in Gujrat; the conflicts and issues around the Vishwamitri Riverfront Development Project (
VRDP
), Ahmedabad.
Migration
With themes like collectivisation of migrant workers, flows of remittances, childcare and health of these workers, the role of caste in their lives, chain migration, and issues faced by the families of migrant workers, the panel on migration delved into the intricacies of the lived reality of migration and labour.
The findings from one of the studies showed that migrant labourers from north India tend to settle in camps, and that it was thus easier for the labour officers to contact them.
However, workers migrating from the states in south India tend to move with their families and thus are more dispersed. The lack of awareness of the benefits available to them, along with the bureaucracy involved in availing these benefits, impacts their already difficult situations.
The
MA
Development students of Azim Premji University seized the opportunity to not only observe but also actively participate and engage in the broad socio-political challenges that our country faces.
Studying these issues in books and making notes is one way to go, but these students lived through each second of their experiences and held accountability for their spheres of interest. They meticulously seeped into the cores of their studies and reflected their insights cogently.
Adding to all the research and factual literature that they studied, the field experience also invokes a sense of empathy and responsibility in them.
Though most conflicting projects that the students covered require large-scale revamping and governmental revolution, these students came up with basic ways to proceed, ultimately for the creation of a better society.
This opportunity can shape their personalities with a sense of consciousness and resilience and open doorways to numerous career prospects.

Field research and experiences of MA in Development students
MA
in Development
At Azim Premji University, we envision a world that is equitable, just, humane and sustainable. We view ​‘development’ as a process as much as an outcome. We realise that achieving such an aim requires engagement with the market, state, and community-based institutions to find inclusive pathways and overcome hurdles, especially for those whose voices are not heard.

Domestic Workers and the Challenges of Collective Action in Informal Work
Azim Premji University,
May 2018
Read Online
Abstract
Domestic workers (henceforth,
DW
), are a part of the large
​
‘
informal’ sector of urban economy and society in India.ii According to the
NSSO
data, over the last two decades, the
DW
populationiii has emerged as the second largest urban informal workforce (Chen and Raveendran 2011), next only to
​
‘
home based workers’ (artisans and petty commodity producers). According to the
NSS
68
th
round (July 2011- June 2012), it is estimated that 41.3 lakhs workers work in the households of others, and an overwhelming 27.9 lakhs of this total are women.iv An increasing number of studies are emerging about DW
s
around the world including the phenomenon of international migration of DW
s
for work. This paper is a critical commentary on the collectivization of DW
s
, based upon an ongoing empirical study that combines ethnographic and quantitative inquiry among DW
s
in different parts of Bengaluru, India. Our aim here is to provide readers with general insights into some of the key struggles of and prospects for domestic workers in a particular context – DW
s
who work in a mega-city and in multiple homes (rather than as live-ins).

Labour Migration in India: Perspectives and Policies for Practice
A 6‑day course to critically explore debates and viewpoints on migration in India.
Medium of instruction
English
Course Faculty

Rajesh Joseph
Past Batch
May 2025 Batch
Internal labour migration is an overwhelming reality underscoring India’s developmental landscape. Millions of people are on the move across the country, in search of a livelihood and adequate means of survival. While migration opens up new vistas of work and employment, creating new opportunities for many, it also pushes people into unequal and highly exploitative work regimes. On one hand, migration gives people an exit option from issues that ail a rural society (such as agrarian distress and caste violence), but on the other, migration has its own methods of exploitation. The recent pandemic has highlighted the vulnerabilities of migrants’ lives even further, questioning their belongingness to the city where many have spent several years.
Despite migration being widespread, it remains poorly understood as a socio-historical, cultural and an economic phenomenon. There is a compelling need to build a critical understanding of migration from different vantage points, locating migration at the cusp of changing nature of work, market and state interventions.
In such a scenario, it is important to understand what migration means to the migrants themselves. What do different patterns of labour migration really tell us about the changing nature of work and about migration itself? Can rapid urbanisation and the growth of cities become a beacon of hope for migrant workers? These questions can help the participants dive further into the issues of working conditions, safe migration and strategies of organising the migrants, with a focus on women migrants and informal work. This will enable them to interrogate the State policies related to labour migration.
Keeping these issues in view, and the contradictions that surround labour migration, Azim Premji University, Bengaluru is offering a certificate course for development practitioners.
What does this course offer?
The course will explore critically, and in-depth, the debates and diverse viewpoints through which migration in India is understood and represented. The learning objectives of the course are to:
Explore theoretical frameworks and empirical knowledge on labour migration.
Critically analyse the dynamics of internal labour migration in India as a contemporary social and economic reality.
Explore key development agendas from a migration lens and analyse the related policy frameworks.
Eligibility and Selection
This course is open to early and mid-career professionals who are working in the domain of migration and related domains like urbanisation, informal labour, labour rights and others interested in learning more about migration in India. Depending upon availability, some seats may be open to research scholars studying labour and migration. All applicants must possess a working knowledge of English. Applicants will be shortlisted based on their written applications. The last date for submitting applications is
15
April 2025
. The selected candidates will be informed by
20
April 2025
.
Certificate of Participation
Participants should expect a rigorous six-day programme in terms of participation, self-learning and assessment. Participants will receive a
​
‘
Certificate of Participation’ from Azim Premji University upon attending all the sessions.

Report: Covid-19 crisis: Survey on internal challenges faced by social sector organisations
Azim Premji University
Download
Abstract
This report is based on a study to understand how the Social Sector Organisations (SSO
s
) are adapting their operations and resources to the challenges posed by the pandemic and the kind of changes they anticipate in the social sector in the next few years as they adjust to a post-Covid world. The study specifically focuses on the internal organisational changes of SSO
s
both in the short-term and medium-term.
The situation assessment study was carried out over five months during January-May 2021. The study was carried in two parts: (a) A survey of SSO
s
followed by (b) qualitative in-depth interviews with senior management of select organisations.
Of the 107 organisations that responded to the survey, we identified 28 respondents for the qualitative interviews, covering small, medium and large organisations operating in different states and domains such as livelihoods, health, education, human rights and gender.
The findings are organised into the following categories:
a. Humanitarian work carried out by SSO
s
b. Impact of the pandemic on the existing programmes of SSO
s
c. Impact of the pandemic on the workforce of SSO
s
d. Impact on funding to SSO

July 2025 Batch
January 2025 Batch
The two- and half-day short course is intended for working professionals from
CSR
departments/​teams with a minimum of two years of work experience in
CSR
.
Introduction
The two- and half-day short course is designed to equip the participants with foundational perspectives and skills that are required to make
CSR
more effective and aligned to development goals and priorities. These include a broad understanding of the purpose of
CSR
, needs and challenges of the social sector and integrating the
CSR
policies and strategies with the organization’s values as well as the requirements of the social sector.
The origins of corporate social responsibility (
CSR
) in India can be found in Gandhi’s philosophy of trusteeship, which when applied to modern day corporations, goes beyond the narrow focus on
​
‘
maximizing shareholder benefits’ to a larger sense of social responsibility. Therefore, capitalists and corporations with access to resources are now essentially seen as trustees of those resources on behalf of society. This implies that the corporations are an integral part of society and are accountable not only to their shareholders, but also to society in general. With a view to mainstream the idea of corporate citizenship and business responsibilities, Government of India introduced the Voluntary guidelines on
CSR
in 2009 which were refined and reframed as National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business in 2011. Subsequently, since April 01, 2014, these guidelines were mandated under section 135 of Companies Act 2013.
Since then, India has seen a significant growth in
CSR
spending and as data from 2023 – 24 shows, more than 24,000 companies have spent Rs 30,000 crore on
CSR
activities, a significant proportion of this funding going to sectors such as education, health and sanitation, environment, rural development, gender equality, etc
[1]
. Consequently, we are at a stage now where there is both a significant need and interest in deepening
CSR
engagement with the social sector to support development activities that will reduce socioeconomic inequalities and contribute to inclusive growth.  In this course, we seek to improve the understanding and capacity of working professionals in the
CSR
sector to further such goals.
The course will be delivered through a mix of participant-led discussions, case studies, group activities, group discussions and lectures. The focus will be on drawing from and building on participants’ experiences. We will invite external resource persons to conduct specific sessions.

Labour Migration in India:  Advanced Perspectives for Practice
A 6 day course to critically explore debates and viewpoints on migration in India.
Medium of instruction
English
Course Faculty
Puja Guha
Rajesh Joseph
Past Batch
December 2022 Batch
Internal labour migration is an overwhelming reality that underscores India’s developmental landscape. While migration opens up new vistas of work and employment for millions of people on the move, creating new opportunities for many, it also pushes people into unequal and highly exploitative work regimes. On one hand, migration gives people an exit from issues that ail a rural society (such as agrarian distress and caste violence), but on the other, migration reconfigures its own methods of exploitation. The recent pandemic has highlighted the vulnerabilities of migrants’ lives even further, questioning their belongingness to the city where many have spent several years.
In such a scenario, what has migration meant to the migrants themselves? What do different patterns of labour migration really tell us about the changing nature of work and about migration itself? Can rapid urbanization and the growth of cities become a beacon of hope for migrant workers? What can one say about the distressed condition of rural and agricultural areas in the country, and their role in spurring the exodus from India’s countryside? What is the nature of the impact of migration on rural and urban areas?
Despite migration being widespread, it remains poorly understood as a socio-historical, cultural and an economic phenomenon. There is indeed a compelling need to build a critical understanding of migration from different vantage points, locating migration at the cusp of changing nature of work, market and state interventions, and crisis. Keeping these realities in view, and the contradictions that surround labour migration, Azim Premji University, Bangalore is offering a short course for development practitioners.
Pedagogy
The course will be transacted in English, on a face-to-face mode. Various kinds of resources will be used, including class lectures, audio visual material, short films etc.
What does the Course offer?
1. To provide an overview of the labour migration landscape in India
2. Critically analyze the dynamics of internal labour migration in India as a contemporary social and economic reality.
3. Explore the push and pull factors of migration, both from the source and destination point.
4. Explore key development agendas from a migration lens, analyzing related policy concerns.
Eligibility Criteria
This course is open to mid-career professionals who are working in and on migration, urbanization, informality, agrarian transformations, labour questions and others interested in learning more about migration in India. Depending upon availability, some seats may be open to research scholars studying labour and migration. All applicants must possess a working knowledge of English.
Certificate of Participation
Participants should expect a rigorous six-day program in terms of participation, self-learning and assessment. Those who participate in the course on all days will receive a
​
‘
Certificate of Participation’ from Azim Premji University.

Social Sector Organisations: Forms and Actions
The role of social sector organisations in actions ranging from
sangharsh
to
nirmaan
and impacts at the grassroots.

Rajesh Joseph
Specialisation
Social sector organisations
This concentration is to help you understand the evolution and purpose of social sector organisations (
SSO
) and the regulatory frameworks that govern them. The terms
​
‘
social sector organisations’ refers to development organisations, third sector organisations, voluntary organisations, NGO
s
and terms for non-sate, non-market organisations working on issues of development. It also includes social enterprises.
You will develop the capacity to build and sustain member-based organisations, design and plan interventions with organisational strategy and to monitor and evaluate programmes and interventions in SSO
s
.
This concentration comprises of four courses.
Understanding Social Sector Organisations
Social sector organisations (SSO
s
) can be broadly classified into not-for-profit and for-profit, and are diverse in their nature of work, funding sources, legal forms, geographies, communities and end users they engage with. Each type of
SSO
comprises many legal forms and these organisational forms have emerged in specific sociopolitical contexts and their evolution is governed by legal frameworks.
This course will use the
​
‘
economic theory of the firm’ lens to analyse select forms of organisations and critically assess the need for different forms. It will include case studies on member-based organisations such as cooperatives, for-profit organisations such as those registered under companies act and not-for-profit organisations such as societies, trusts and Section 8 companies.
The course will trace the evolution of select organisational forms in-depth and help examine purpose and the socio-political context that shapes the work of SSO
s
. The course will also guide students to engage with current debates on changing orientation and working of SSO
s
, and their relevance in the current context. This course is not meant to be a
​
‘
how to’ guide on legal and statutory requirements of organisations.
Planning and Designing Development Interventions
This course focuses on the programmes and interventions by SSO
s
, locating them in the context of organisational mission, vision, goal and strategic plans, tracing how organisational practices and priorities flow from the organisational goals and strategic plans.
This course is meant for building competencies in designing an intervention and developing an action plan for its implementation.You will pick up the skills to analyse programmes of SSO
s
in relation to their organisational mission, vision, mandates and strategic plan.
Conceptualising and designing development action will involve ability to use needs assessment tools, analysing and prioritising problems, identifying solutions and designing interventions in line with the organisation’s goals. You will use hands-on exercises, interactions with practitioners and examples from real-life interventions in order apply the results framework and develop the objectives, activities, timeline and budget for the intervention.
Building and Sustaining Member-based Organisations
Many SSO
s
and government programmes form member based organisations (MBO
s
) to implement interventions or help communities to engage with the state or market. India has seen a proliferation of various kinds of MBO
s
such as producer groups, cooperatives, savings and credit associations and other collectives in the last three decades.
SSO
s
often grapple with creating viable and self-sustaining MBO
s
. We believe it will be of great value for you to develop competencies to mobilise and build MBO
s
and help them transition into independent and self-reliant entities.
This course will cover the three prevalent types of MBO
s
: groups based on self-help and mutual assistance (such as SHG
s
, producer groups etc), cooperatives, and unions. Through case studies, practitioner-led lectures and simulation exercises, the course will help you identify appropriate community mobilisation strategies used by SSO
s
. You will learn of the process of building these organisations including statutory and legal requirements. We will also study conditions and good practices and challenges (external constraints, internal dynamics and resources) to be mindful of in establishing and nurturing MBO
s
on their path to organisational sustainability.
Development Actions – Monitoring and Evaluation
The course begins by situating evaluation within the larger framework of programme design, planning and implementation and evaluation theories. It offers a critical look at the theory of change underlying it, followed by feasibility studies, which include both qualitative and quantitative ways of assessing resource allocation and socio-economic feasibility of an action. We will address several practical concerns in asking whether the action is
​
‘
worth’ consideration (as per cost effectiveness, cost-benefit analysis and for political purposes).
The course also explores impact evaluation and the outcome traceable to the action and will introduce the students to different methods of evaluation by covering relevant experimental
&
quasi-experimental causal design methodologies and their critiques, as well as (qualitative
&
quantitative) methods of data collection
&
analysis. The students will also get an exposure to participatory evaluation methods and social audits.
Even though evaluations are often discussed in the context of programme design studies, the course intends to take insights from these studies and apply it to a variety of development action, which will be discussed using case studies from various developmental domains.

Participatory Approaches to Research and Social Action
Developing Analytical Case Studies
The first course will focus on using space, time and relational Participatory Rural Appraisal (

The second course will help participants learn how to systematically collect data, analyse and write analytical case studies focusing on individuals, communities and organisations.
The course pedagogy is designed specifically for practitioners, combining theory with hands-on practice. Participants will also be exposed to multiple examples from the field and encouraged to bring in their own experiences and challenges.
The programme will be delivered in a
hybrid mode
with
two weeks of face-to-face classes
followed by
online classes
.
What will you learn

Gender and Livelihoods: A Gender Transformative Approach
Enabling practitioners to introspect on their work and integrate a gender transformative approach in their programmes.
Medium of instruction

Past Batch
July 2025 Batch
In the last two or three decades, Government and Non- Governmental programmes have been targeting women and women’s groups as a strategy to meet their development goals. However, many of these programmes use a service delivery approach or an inclusion lens that address the practical needs rather than the strategic needs of women. Such programmes often leave existing power structures underlying the world of work unaltered and unchallenged. This results in incremental benefits to women without any substantial change in their overall status in family, community and market. Development programmes sometimes also take an instrumentalist view of women’s role in economic development without investing sufficiently in women’s own agency, voice and visibility. As a result, the programmes often fall short of creating substantial transformative change on the ground.
Keeping these critical concerns in view, Azim Premji University, Bengaluru is offering a short course for development practitioners to address these issues and gaps, to enable practitioners to introspect on their own work and integrate a gender transformative approach in their programmes. The course will be offered in-person at the Bengaluru campus of the University.
What does this course offer?
The course will explore how gender inequalities shape and influence labour and livelihoods, and the measures required for livelihood interventions to become gender transformative.
The learning outcomes of the course are:
To discern how gender and power across family, community, state and market institutions impact livelihoods opportunities, choices, and outcomes
To use an intersectional approach to examine the relationship between gender and labour
To comprehend how to integrate gender lens in livelihoods interventions
Thematic topics to be covered:
The course will explore the following thematic topics
Patriarchy, institutions, organising of women’s work
Intersectionality and gendered work: Class, caste, disability and sexualities
Globalisation, informalisation and feminisation of work
Gender and technology
Measuring women’s work ‑Time use studies
Gender budgeting
Gender mainstreaming in livelihoods
Eligibility and Selection
This course will be offered to organisations/​practitioners who work or intend to work in the domain of livelihoods. This includes individuals working in the livelihood programmes of Government and NGO
s
, consultants working in the livelihoods space, research scholars and journalists who write on these issues. The participants should have a minimum of 2 years of work experience in the development sector. The criteria are set keeping in mind the intent that the participant would be able to integrate the learnings from the course in their practice within their field and organisational contexts. All applicants must possess a working knowledge of English. Azim Premji University is committed to diversity and inclusion, and we encourage participants with different genders, disabilities and social backgrounds to apply.
Applicants will be shortlisted based on their eligibility. The last date for submitting applications is

Why this course?
In the last two or three decades, Government and Non- Governmental programmes have been targeting women and women’s groups as a strategy to meet their development goals. However, many of these programmes use a service delivery approach or an inclusion lens that address the practical needs rather than the strategic needs of women. Such programmes often leave existing power structures underlying the world of work unaltered and unchallenged. This results in incremental benefits to women without any substantial change in their overall status in family, community and market. Development programmes sometimes also take an instrumentalist view of women’s role in economic development without investing sufficiently in women’s own agency, voice and visibility. As a result, the programmes often fall short of creating substantial transformative change on the ground.
Keeping these critical concerns in view, Azim Premji University, Bengaluru is offering a short course for development practitioners to address these issues and gaps, to enable practitioners to introspect on their own work and integrate a gender transformative approach in their programmes. The course will be offered in-person at the Bengaluru campus of the University.
What does this course offer?
The course will explore how gender inequalities shape and influence labour and livelihoods, and the measures required for livelihood interventions to become gender transformative.
The learning outcomes of the course are:
To discern how gender and power across family, community, state and market institutions impact livelihoods opportunities, choices, and outcomes
To use an intersectional approach to examine the relationship between gender and labour
To comprehend how to integrate gender lens in livelihoods interventions

Biography
Varuni Bhatia is the Director of the School of Arts
&
Sciences.
Varuni teaches History at Azim Premji University, Bengaluru. Her research area is religion and modernity in colonial and contemporary India. Bhatia’s books and articles explore transformations of Hindu traditions, new cultural and media practices of religion, and religion at the intersection of nationalism and identity. In her first book,
Unforgetting Chaitanya: Vaishnavism and Cultures of Devotion in Colonial Bengal
(Oxford University Press, 2017), Bhatia explored the coalescing of a modern, reformed, and socially conservative Vaishnavism in colonial Bengal at the interstices of history, culture, and anti-colonial nationalism. Her forthcoming book is an Oxford India Short Introduction called
Religion in India
where she provides a readable and scholarly overview of religion’s lasting significance in contemporary India and its social, legal, and media landscapes.
More recently, Professor Bhatia has been looking into the phenomenon of new media practices and the religious lives of Indians in contemporary India. She is currently working on her next book, provisionally titled
Spiritual Journeys: Global Occult and the Secret Histories of Modern Hinduism
, where she traces the global intellectual histories of several subterranean aspects of modern Hinduism that stand askance to its reformed aspects.
Professor Bhatia has a Masters and MPhil in History from Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, and PhD in Religion from Columbia University, New York. She has previously taught at New York University and University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Doing History
Introduces students to methods and tools used by historians and also encourages them to start thinking historically.
Facilitators

Programme
BA in History
This is one of the foundational courses in the History major. It is designed bearing in mind that not all students entering the History major come with an understanding of the basic concepts of the discipline, or an awareness of its methodological tools. This course will skill students in practising history by teaching them to think historically, rather than being (often passive) consumers of historical narratives. What is History? How is History practised as an academic discipline? What are some of the methodological tools used by professional historians to practise History? And what are some of History’s foundational concepts? By addressing each of these questions, this course aims to foster thinking about and actively doing history amongst students.

Biography
Samira a historian of Early Modern South Asia with an interest in religion and its entanglements with political economy. She is currently working on a monograph tentatively titled
The Many Dargahs of Nagore: Relocating Tamil Islam in the Bay of Bengal Littoral.
The book analyses the rise to prominence of South India’s most celebrated Sufi, the sixteenth-century figure Shahul Hamid, and the shrine that emerged around his burial site in Nagore, on the Coromandel Coast.
Alongside, she is also working on an article on the forgotten history of
Islamic
Carnatic music. Here she intends to explore the rich archive of songbooks containing
raga
-based compositions written in Tamil by the Muslim poets of South India. She is also trying to find out whether these songs were performed, and if so, what happened to that music tradition in the contemporary period.
She earned her PhD in December 2019 from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and her
MA
and MPhil degrees from Jawaharlal Nehru University (
JNU
), New Delhi, and Centre for Studies in Social Sciences, Calcutta (
CSSSC
), respectively.
She worked for a few years in the book publishing industry, at Tulika Books and Routledge, New Delhi.
Apart from research and teaching, she enjoys listening to music and singing, baking and trying new recipes, and learning new skills – both artistic and practical.

Facilitator
Samira Junaid
Programme
BA in History
The purpose of the course is to give students a view of the Indian subcontinent from a
longue durée
, non-national, oceanic perspective. It also gives them a glimpse of the degree to which the pre-modern maritime space was both globalised and cosmopolitan, features we typically associate with societies of the modern period. The course will build on students’ engagement with the sources and methods of History, in addition to introducing them to the chronology and logic underlying historiographical shifts in the field of Indian Ocean Studies and Maritime history. Organised both chronologically and thematically, the course will give students a) an awareness of the long history of India’s maritime links with the various countries that today constitute the Indian Ocean littoral (and beyond); b) an appreciation of the historical significance of maritime commerce to both inland polities and coastal societies; c) greater understanding of the networks of goods, people, technologies, and ideas that animated these maritime routes; and d) knowledge of the political contestations and cooperation entailed in keeping the commerce safe and profitable.

State and Society in Pre-Colonial India (c.800‑1800)
What was pre-colonial India like?
Facilitators
Varuni Bhatia
Samira Junaid
Specialisation
Precolonial India
If you think about precolonial India, what comes to mind? Do you think of movies like
Jodha Akbar
and
Bajirao Mastai
or
Padmavat
? Or do you think of the Taj Mahal, and qawwalis, and poets like Kabir and Bulle Shah?
If you do ask what precolonial India was really like, and how people lived, you will need to learn about forms of government that existed, various wars that were fought, and the ways in which empires were built and brought down. In this course, we do this by learning about the Cholas, Sultanate emperors, Deccan Sultans, the Vijayanagara Kingdom, the Mughals and Marathas. We explore how people lived, along with various regional and religious politics and the forms of art and culture that grew.
In this course, we explore some of these questions to understand facts of a very significant time in Indian history. You will understand what changes have occured in the Indian polity and society over a period of 800 years. We do this by exploring several historical sources: paintings to coins, inscriptions to archaeological remnants, and of course, written and oral texts. This course includes a look at history and the present, and key historiographical debates around this period of Indian history.

The History and Philosophy majors at Azim Premji University aim to equip students with competencies around careful and critical reading, analysis using a variety of methodologies, and writing to communicate ideas to both specialist and non-specialist audiences. These capabilities are difficult, and best acquired through close and in-depth study of one area. This course is designed especially keeping in mind those students who opt for thesis or project based honors projects. All those students who take up the honors track are required to take this course on research methodology and academic writing. While currently intended for History and Philosophy students, in future it may be offered to all Humanities students pursuing the honors track.

Environmental history
This course introduces students to key issues around which environmental history as a field evolved. Additionally, it also introduces the methods through which the quotient of human environment equation as an analytical lens emerged for historical studies. The course follows a non-linear pattern in its organisation. It introduces the historical and historiographical context within which environmental history emerged as a technique of historical enquiry and subsequent conceptual developments in this field. This is a 20
th
century phenomenon. It then reverts back in time to undertake a broad survey of the key concerns and questions of the human environment equation that emerge in the historical enquiries through prehistoric, early history era, middle ages and all the way to the emergence of modern and contemporary historical developments.

The Intellectual and Cultural Aspects of Modernity
How did modernity come to be in India and what shaped it as it is?
Facilitator
Subir Dey
This course helps you understand the ways in which knowledge and power shaped modernity for the non-Western world, and India in particular. You will also learn how modernity as an idea was produced by an encounter of the West with non-Western locations. You will learn how modernity is a heterogeneous idea that is defined by different publics and people, the powerful and the powerless. In particular, we see how
​
‘
modernity’ is understood in different realms of art, literature, religion, science and law and the philosophical and cultural complexities that surround it. This course complements the core course in Literature called Literature of the Modern: 20
th
century.

Colonial India: Polity, Economy and Culture
How was the course of Indian history shaped by colonial governance? How did the East India Company slowly become the colonial state?
Facilitators
Amit Kumar
Subir Dey
In this course, you will understand this through a look at specific material practices used by the colonial state to transform various aspects of the everyday life of its subjects in the Indian subcontinent in the 19
th
and 20
th
centuries. The course will take you through a look at new agrarian forms produced by colonial legislation (for eg, Permanent Settlement Act and the Ryotwari system); innovations in the name of science and technology introduced in realms of geology, irrigation, botanical science, textile production, the telegraph and the railways; and the social transformation of caste as shaped through contestations around the body of the woman, to name a few. We will study important political struggles and insurrections of the period and the colonial response to these. You will build the skills to understand India in historical terms and the multiplicity of the colonial state and politics around it.

Empires and Imperialism
Explores the historical forces that led, in the 18
th
-19
th
centuries, to the creation of European imperial colonies all around the globe.
Facilitator
Subir Dey
Programme
BA in History
The course introduces students to the large-scale historical processes which culminated in the formation of colonies in various parts of the world with a comparative analysis of different forms of colonial practices from 17
th
to mid-20
th
century. The course takes a broader outlook on various colonial practices – like slave plantations in various parts of Latin America, settler colonialism in Americas and slave trade in and from Africa. It also looks at the imperialist policies and practices in shaping the middle east the way it emerged in the 19
th
and 20
th
centuries. The other purpose of the course is to have a descriptive account of the emerging networks of power both at
​
‘
centres’ and
​
‘
peripheries’ while simultaneously exploring the debates on industrial revolution, scientific revolution, expansion of capitalism and colonial state-formation. The course also tries to engage with the various theories and practices of anti-colonial/anti-imperialist resistance emerging from various sections of former colonies.

Biography
What role does nature have to play in making cities more sustainable? How can one contribute to making the cities we live in more equitable? These are the questions that drive Seema’s current research interests.
Seema enjoys exploring different aspects of urban sustainability along with students from the University and from other institutions as they bring with them interesting questions and lenses through which they explore cityscapes. What Seema is especially interested in is making research accessible to a wider audience.
Her recently co-authored books (with Harini Nagendra),
​
“
Shades of Blue: Connecting the Drops in India’s Cities” (Penguin India),
​
“
Cities and Canopies: Trees in Indian Cities” (Penguin India), and
​
“
So Many Leaves” (Pratham Books) are attempts in this direction.
Seema is also interested in action research, for example understanding the impacts of development projects on urban green cover, that can contribute even in a small way to bridging the divide between the binary of development and environment.
She did her Master’s in Business Administration and initially worked in the corporate sector but moved to work with NGO
s
involved in conservation, mining, land and forest rights, and education of indigenous communities. Her shift to working in the urban context began after her second Postgraduate degree, a Master’s in Development at the University in 2014.
She found the real meaning of life after she got her pet cats, and now also fosters orphaned and abandoned kittens as part of the Bangalore Cat Squad.

Climate data democracy is essential for climate action
PLOS Climate,
July 2024
Read Online
Abstract
When
NASA
provided free worldwide access to the Landsat data archive, scientists greatly expanded the analysis of new locations and novel topics. Of course, data democracy is not just for scientists. When citizens own the rights to generate and access data that speaks to their concerns, democracy is strengthened. Data democracy began to gain prominence in the early 2000s, with the growth of the open data movement. In today’s era of climate change, the term assumes increasing significance. Yet despite the large volume of opensource climate data, access remains largely limited to academia and business. Climate data democracy enables all sections of society to access climate data; understand how to use and interpret it; and be able to use data for climate action. Given the lack of data and severity of the crisis in the Global South, we argue that these regions must take the lead in driving conversations around climate data democracy.

Biography
Harini Nagendra is Director of Research Centre, and Director,
School of Climate Change and Sustainability
, at the university.
She is known for her research spanning over 30 years on forest conservation, and urban sustainability, with several seminal publications in both areas of work. Her interdisciplinary work on forests combines remote sensing, biodiversity studies and institutional analysis, and is recognised for elucidating the link between pattern and process in the human-dominated landscapes of South Asia.
Her work on urban ecology and sustainability highlights the importance of urban ecosystems in contributing critical ecosystem services and impacting urban resilience and human well-being, especially of marginalised communities — an important global gap, especially for the Global South.
For her interdisciplinary research and practice, she has received many awards including the 2009 Cozzarelli Prize from the
US
National Academy of Sciences, the 2013 Elinor Ostrom Senior Scholar award, and the 2017 Clarivate Web of Science award.

‘
Songs of the lake’: Understanding cultural expressions of nature through dwindling folk-songs and mythologies in Bengaluru
South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies,
February 2023
Read Online
Abstract
Culture-specific knowledge plays an important role in shaping environmental conservation. Yet we lack a holistic and contemporary understanding of how such local cultural systems interface(d) with ecologies, especially in the fast-growing cities of the Global South which face profound environmental challenges. In this paper, we explore nature-based cultural systems embedded in folk-songs to understand situated social-ecological histories of human-inhabited peri-urban landscapes in the city of Bengaluru in South India. Drawing on empirical observations from the city, we trace local imageries of erstwhile lake-based social systems through folk-songs, mythologies and oral narratives. We demonstrate how many of these cultural narratives, largely embedded within symbolic linkages to the lake ecology, continue to manifest themselves as folk expressions in the city, despite the fact that most of the lakes have been polluted or are managed via restrictions that prohibit village residents from accessing them as they once did for agriculture, livelihoods and domestic use. The songs are also rich reminders of socialities, which, despite being divisive and hierarchical to a large extent, were symbolically and materially embedded in nature.

Forests of Life
A journey through India’s forests.
Building on the success of Rivers of Life in 2022, the second edition of our public climate festival Forests of Life, was held in 2023 – 24.  This tri-lingual public event used the metaphor of the Indian festival to celebrate the joy of nature and communicate issues of sustainability and climate change through a multi-sensorial and participatory format.  It brought together information collected by student interns from forests across the length and breadth of India, along with a range of other educational material.

Through diverse perspectives from the point of view of urban dwellers, indigenous communities, and wildlife, the festival explored the idea of the forest, engaging with youth — school and college students — across different parts of the country.  Like all journeys, Forests of Life was a quest, a search, a
yatra
—where stories were collected and new tales created.
In addition to photo exhibitions, the event comprised activity-based learning, film screenings followed by discussions, inspiring stories of successful conservation efforts, interactions with indigenous communities, folk art, music, expert-led workshops, intern talks, and teacher education workshops — all aimed at fostering a collaborative, interactive and enriching atmosphere of nature-based learning.
Each story revealed different shades of the forest. Some narratives spoke of sustaining forest-dependent livelihoods, while others described the challenges of human-animal conflicts.  Stories also delved deep into the association of indigenous communities with nature, and discussed value chains that could positively contribute to improved livelihoods.
Through these narratives, we looked at successful wildlife relocations and learnt about inspirational stories of individuals and communities who conserve our last remaining wildlands.

Mountains of Life
Come join us on a journey through India’s mountains
With the planet in turmoil and the climate crisis affecting our daily lives, the Mountains of Life festival brought together the curious minds to reflect on the human impact on nature and the urgent need for conservation.
Azim Premji University’s annual climate festival, after exploring distant rivers and ancient forests in previous editions, turned its focus to the mountains in 2024. From 13 – 26 November 2024 in Bengaluru campus, followed by 04 – 09 December in Bhopal campus, and later in other locations, the festival became a space for conversations, creativity, and action.
The festival brought together interns, students, volunteers, artists, researchers, young professionals, teachers, and community members to create a multi-layered narrative of mountains as a critical and inseparable part of nature. Their stories and reflections highlighted the state of our planet and the struggles we face in responding to the growing crisis — why conversations about nature are often sidelined, why we continue to harm our own life sustaining systems when we understand its intrinsic value, and why some communities choose to resist and conserve against all challenges. They shared how these journeys transformed them as individuals and, above all, expressed hope— that their efforts will affect someone significantly enough to think about the environment even as they go about their daily lives.
As the festival travels to different locations, it follows the same engaging format — featuring numerous photo essays, infographics, art and immersive installations, traditional performances and music celebrating mountains, interactive workshops, thought-provoking talks, and more. Open to school and college students, families, and curious visitors, the festival continues to bring together diverse voices and ideas, strengthening the commitment to conservation while inspiring and educating the next generation.
Coming soon to Dehradun!
The festival has engaged 31,589 visitors across eight locations between November 2024 and March 2025. Spanning Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan, the festival has drawn diverse audiences at university campuses, cultural institutions, and district institutes of the Azim Premji Foundation.

There are rapid and widespread environmental, economic and social changes in the world that have led to urgent global questions of sustainability. These concerns take on different contours in developing countries like India, different from questions in industrialised countries. In developing countries, equity and social justice with regard to environmental concerns are central in the process of addressing sustainability.

We develop an integrated perspective on sustainability along ecological and social dimensions and use these to examine critical themes of importance to India, like population, food, and climate change.
We explore how our imagination of culture, markets, state, and even of nature itself influences sustainability action. We end with examining how to take sustainability action — as individuals, communities and larger collectives, and across all scales, from the local to the global.
You are expected to watch video lectures, join interactive video-discussions with faculty, and participate in discussion forums.
